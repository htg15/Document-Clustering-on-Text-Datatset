Note the early use of\\nPostScript technology, predating many of this year\\'s papers listed in the\\nApril 1st SIGGRAPH Program Announcement posted here a few days ago.\\n\\n-- Eric\\n\\n\\nIntersection Between a Line and a Polygon (UNDECIDABLE??),\\n\\tby Dave Baraff, Tom Duff\\n\\n\\tFrom: deb@charisma.graphics.cornell.edu\\n\\tNewsgroups: comp.graphics\\n\\tKeywords: P, NP, Jordan curve separation, Ursyhon Metrization Theorem\\n\\tOrganization: Program of Computer Graphics\\n\\n\\nI think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and\\npolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of\\npoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.\\n\\nFirst, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the\\nJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into\\nexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies\\ncompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,\\nor possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.\\n\\nNow, the phrasing of this question says \"if a line intersects a polygon\", so\\nthis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is\\nto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\\nsolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.\\n\\nIn recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a\\nnew language called PostScript.  (See \"PostScript Language\", by Adobe Systems\\nIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\\n\\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that\\ndraws the line L and the polygon P, and then \"outputs\" the answer.  By\\n\"output\", we mean the program executes a command called \"showpage\", which\\nactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick\\nexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus\\nthe original problem.\\n\\nThere are two small problems with this approach. \\n\\n\\t(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the\\n\\treduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice (or equivalently, Zorn\\'s Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\\n\\n\\t(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the\\n\\tPostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in\\n\\tother words, will it halt?\\n\\n\\tNow, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a\\n\\tTuring Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is\\n\\tundecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn\\n\\tout to be undecidable.\\n\\n\\nI won\\'t even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite\\nprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.\\n\\nA couple of references might be:\\n\\n1.

By the well known\\nDobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc.\\n37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to\\nHamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an\\nacronym) is probably only NP-complete.  Besides, Turing-completeness will no\\nlonger be a problem once our Cray-3 is delivered, since it will be able to\\ncomplete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.)\\n\\n--------\\n\\nFrom: deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu (David Baraff)\\n\\nWell, sure its no worse than NP-complete, but that\\'s ONLY if you restrict\\nyourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its\\nsecond derivative.  (I think there\\'s an \\'89 SIGGRAPH paper from Caltech that\\ndeals with this).\\n\\n--',\n",

There were literally thousands\\n  of incidents continuously until World War I, in Southeastern Europe as far\\n  west and north as Monastir and Kavalla, in Istanbul, at Gallipoli and\\n  the Dardanelles, at Salonica, and in all the Arab provinces as far south\\n  as Damascus and Beirut and in Egypt at Cairo and Alexandria. These\\n  invariably resulted from accusations spread among Ottoman Christians\\n  by word of mouth, or published in their newspapers, often by Christian\\n  financiers and merchants anxious to get their Jewish competitors out of\\n  the way or to divert onto the Jews Muslim anger at reports of Christian\\n  massacres of Muslims in Southeastern Europe or Central Asia, resulting\\n  in individual and mob attacks on Jews, and the burning of their shops\\n  and homes.\\n\\n  Individual experiences were horrible. Jews constantly went in fear of\\n  Armenian or Greek attacks in the streets of Ottoman cities. In Egypt\\n  and Syria, it was usually the Greeks who led the way, in many cases\\n  with the assistance of local Armenians and Syrian Christians, whose\\n  Greek, Arabic and French-language newspapers often printed all the\\n  rumors they could find regarding Jews, evidently with the desire of\\n  instigating violence. The Syrian Arab Christians in particular spread\\n  their long-standing anti-Semitic hatreds from Syria to Egypt, where\\n  their monopoly of the local press and their espousal of popular causes\\n  such as Egyptian nationalism and opposition to the British rule, enabled\\n  them to spread their anti-Jewish message among the Muslim masses with\\n  little question or opposition.\\n\\n  On 20 June 1890, thus, Sir Evelyn Baring (later Lord Cromer), British\\n  High Commissioner in Egypt, received the following report from David\\n  and Nissim Ades, in Cairo:\\n\\n    \\'\\'Sir,\\n\\n      I beg sir to draw to your attention to the violent articles which\\n      has (sic) appeared in an Arabic paper called El Mahroussa which\\n      contained nothing but lies and false accusations against the Jews,\\n      especially those (the issues) of the 14th, 17th and 19th instant.\\n      Now, Sir, are we to have here an anti-Semitic party amidst fanaticism,\\n      Greeks, Armenians, etc., or is he to be allowed to continue to poison\\n      the people\\'s minds with exaggeration and painted words?

Now you\\'re trying to wriggle out of it.\\nWon\\'t wash, and you know it.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s you, not me, who is running out of arguments.  \\n\\n\\nWhat you said is that \"Judaism is defined according to religious\\nstandards.\"  Now this can have several different meanings, and you know\\nit.  One of the meanings that it can have is to say that \"Only those who\\nare religious are defined as Jews\".  Another is to say that \"Only those\\nwho meet the religious definition of a Jew is one.\"  And there are\\nothers.  I\\'m not twisting your words.  I\\'m trying to make you aware that\\nyour words don\\'t mean what you think they do.\\n\\n\\nActually, it doesn\\'t.

IT WAS an example of how\\nthe definition of a word can be twisted around 180 degrees.  \\n\\n\\nOh, so now what are dictionaries for?\\n\\n\\nDuh.  As a scientist, whose technical terms are very often not found in\\ncommon dictionaries, I know this.  But when a term is common, like\\nhypocrisy, a good dictionary can be regarded as an authoritative source.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s not nonsense.  When people read what you write, they have to try to\\nassociate a meaning to those words.  Dictionaries give the meanings of\\nwords, don\\'t they?  Now, I assume that you\\'d like to have the words you\\nuse mean what you\\'d like them to.  But the fact is, you\\'re using very\\ndifferent meanings than are in the dictionary, or you would like the\\nreader to assign them new meanings, which they never had.  \\n\\n\\nNot at all.

Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as \\nthey ran.

A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death \\nor missing... \\n\\nSeven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter \\nas we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there \\nwas a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer \\nripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We \\nswung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon \\nunder our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.\\n\\nWe had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round \\nagain, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a \\nvalley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung \\nround again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired \\nrepeated blasts.\\n\\nLater it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting \\nhad landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed \\nenclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in \\nfact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter. \\nI had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window, \\nits cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on \\n\"our side\". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a \\nsearch-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.\\n\\nOur flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two \\nM24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed \\nflying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second \\ncrocodile. The civilian helicopter\\'s job was to land in the mountains \\nand pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters \\nwere there to give covering fire if necessary.\\n\\nThe operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet \\narmed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani \\nofficial told us that there were now five former Soviet military \\nhelicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. \"They have \\nsigned contracts to fly for us,\" he said. The helicopter we engaged \\nin combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian \\npilot, but fighting for the Armenians.\\n\\nWe had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an \\nheated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer \\nwhite wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four \\ncorpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an \\nAzerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies \\non the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back \\ntowards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before \\nthe plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.\\n\\nBack at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the \\ncivilian helicopter had picked up.

       " '\\nThis is quite a misrepresentation.  After WWI, many Bosnian Muslims were\\nkilled and their land taken over by Serbs, and the motive was plunder,\\nnot some fictitious \"supression of rebellion.\"  Even earlier, one can\\npoint to the destruction of mosques in Serbia itself and expulsion of\\nMuslims.  Here is what Dr. Vaso Cubrilovic, political adviser to the\\nSerbian monarchic regime, says in his memorandum \"The Expulsion of the\\nArnauts\" which he presented to the royal government of Stojadinovic\\non March 7, 1937, in Belgrade:\\n\\n   The Mode of Removal\\n   -------------------\\n\\n   [ describes how expulsion of ethnic Albanians from Kosova is to proceed\\n   through state terror and \"private initiative\", i.e. Chetnik plunder: ]\\n\\n   Private initiative, too, can assist greatly in this direction.  We should\\n   distribute weapons to our colonists, as need be.  The old forms of Chetnik\\n   action should be organized and secretly assisted.  [...]\\n   ...the whole affair should be presented as a conflict between clans and,\\n   if need be, ascribed to economic reasons.  Finally, local riots can be\\n   incited.  These will be bloodily suppressed with the clans and the\\n   Chetniks, rather than the army.\\n\\n   There remains one more means, WHICH SERBIA EMPLOYED WITH GREAT PRACTICAL\\n   EFFECT AFTER 1878, that is, by secretly burning down Albanian villages\\n   and city quarters.\\n\\n(Emphasis above is mine.)  These events in Serbia itself forced out virtually\\nall Muslims during late 19th century.  This policy of state terrorism\\nagainst Muslims, aided by Chetnik \"private initiative,\" has continued in WWII\\nand today.  For example, Muhamed Hadzijahic in his book \"Od tradicije do \\nidentiteta: Geneza nacionalnog pitanja bosanskih Muslimana\" (Sarajevo:\\nSvjetlost, 1974) writes (pg. 235) how Serbs killed a Muslim in Foca\\nin WWII even though he claimed to be a Serbian patriot, explaining\\ntheir action as follows:\\n\\n   \"Inasmuch as you were a Serb, you sullied the Serb name, because you\\n   are a Turk [i.e. Muslim].  And since you helped us, we shall not\\n   torture you.\"\\n\\nso the shot him instead of cutting his throat.  In the past year, Serbs\\nhave repeated the slaughter of Muslim residents of Foca.  Destruction\\nof mosques, including priceless historical monuments, completes the\\neradication of the Muslim presence from territories claimed by Serbs.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhich part do you claim is untrue?  Explain yourself, or withdraw your claim.\\n\\n\\nCroatia never had many Muslim citizens for historical reasons, because it\\nwas not a part of the Ottoman Empire.  The last major battles between\\nAustro-Hungarian monarchy and the Ottoman Empire in Croatia were at the\\nend of the 17th century.  Need I remind you that modern Croatian nationalism\\ncame into being with Dr. Ante Starcevic, who saw Bosnian Muslims as the\\nbest Croats, so much so that in 1853 he contemplated moving his operations \\nto Sarajevo?  You are confusing clericalist Croatianism with Croatian\\nnationalism here.   Political nationalism has always been stronger.  As\\nfor your other theories, you are clearly overjoyed that Croat-Muslim\\nalliance in Bosnia-Herzegovina is now in trouble.  Arguments such as\\nyours are clearly intended to create and deepen this split.  \\n\\n\\nIn international relations 101 you\\'ll learn that unless weak unite to\\ncounterbalance the strong player, soon they are taken over and that\\'s the\\nend of them.  Balance of power thinking has brought together Croats\\nand Bosnian Muslims.  This is only natural; all other alignments are\\nunstable.  I\\'m working on pointing out this basic fact: Croats and\\nMuslims have been aware of it for as long as Serbia has existed.  \\nYou are wrong if you think only \"image\" is at stake here.  Croatia has\\na deep interest in her alliance with Bosnian Muslims, and vice versa.  \\n\\nI think Tudjman understands this, although he does not have much choice \\nat this point.  Tensions should have been defused better earlier, before \\nany open confrontation developed.  Although I still think Croatia will\\nsurvive, it will lose a lot; but Bosnian Muslims may end up even worse\\noff.  However, their position now is so horrible that perhaps they do not\\nsee it getting any worse.  The key point is: do they still have any hope left?\\nIf not, then all bets are off.\\n\\nMr. Stojanovic is clearly very, very happy about this.

Both aspects of the\\ntwo-pronged concept of \"Hebrew labor\" have racist connotations. On\\nthe one hand, the diaspora Jew\\'s lack of training in physical\\nlabor is a myth shared by Zionists and antisemites.  On the other\\nhand, its meaning in practice has been the displacement of the\\nArab farmer from the source of his livelihood.\\n\\nThe occupation and the cheap Palestinian labor which streamed from\\nthe occupied territories to the factories, orchards, and\\nhot-houses of Israel relegated the myth of \"Hebrew labor\" to the\\nhistory books and nostalgic memories of the Zionist Movement.

It provides a\\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\\n  \"program\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\\n  instrument.\\n\\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\\n  the development of custom code.)\\n\\nUltimage Concept VI\\n-------------------\\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\\n\\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\\n  characterization.\\n\\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\\n  be imported.\\n\\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects\\' detection, measurement, and\\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The\\n  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom\\n  modules.\\n\\n  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity\\n  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can\\n  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight\\n  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging\\n  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are\\n  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local\\n  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.\\n  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as\\n  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)\\n  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening\\n  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.\\n\\n  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even\\n  hole filling.\\n\\n  The program\\'s quantitative analysis measurements include: area,\\n  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.\\n\\n  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494\\n  707-579-1733\\n\\nIPLab Spectrum\\n--------------\\n  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the\\n  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by\\n  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user\\n  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far\\n  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool\\n  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a\\n  movie command for cycling through windows.\\n\\n\\nMacintosh-based tools\\n=====================\\n\\nNCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more\\n---------------------------------\\n  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the\\n  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results\\n  from numerical modelling calculations.

Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with\\n  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS\\n  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.\\n  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted\\n  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For\\n  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from\\n  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,\\n  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include\\n  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation\\n  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to\\n  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,\\n  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.\\n\\n  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard\\n  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,\\n  availlable from Storm Technologies.

Several steps are often required to\\n  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The\\n  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can\\n  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.

Image Analyst lets users configure\\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\\n  radiographs.\\n\\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\\n  a disk-stored image.\\n\\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\\n\\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also\\n  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.\\n\\n  Automatix, Inc. 775 Middlesex Turnpike Billerica, MA 01821 508-667-7900\\n\\nIPLab\\n-----\\n  Signal Analytics Corp. 374 Maple Ave. E Vienna, VA  22180 703-281-3277\\n  FAX 703-281-2509\\n\\n  \"Menu-driven image processing software that supports 24-bit color or\\n  pseudocolor/grayscale image display and manipulation.\"\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II distributed by John Wiley has\\n  integrated image analysis.\\n\\nIMAGE\\n-----\\n  from Stanford : Try anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n  It has pd source for image v2, and ready to run code for a mac under\\n  image v3.\\n\\n\\n\\nWindows/DOS PC-based tools\\n==========================\\n\\nCCD\\n---\\n  Richard Berry\\'s CCD imaging book for Willamon-Bell contains (optional?)\\n  disks with image manipulating software.

All functions can be easily accessed via the\\n  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image\\n  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that\\n  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of\\n  modules.\\n\\n  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and\\n  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and\\n  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and\\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\\n  ratioing.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more\\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\\n  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer\\'s environments. Using\\n  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\\n  applications programs.\\n\\n  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick\\n  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,\\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\\n  interactively driven through this control.\\n\\n  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of\\n  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of\\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\\n  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\\n\\n  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\\n  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The\\n  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional\\n  processing of remote sensed data.\\n\\n  For further information, please contact:\\n\\n  The Business Manager, CLOUGH Engineering Group Systems Division, 627\\n  Chapel Street, South Yarra, Australia 3141.

Supports 24-bit display\"\\n\\nHIPS\\n----\\n(Human   Information   Processing Laboratory\\'s Image Processing System)\\n\\n  Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image\\n  processing which has been used for basically all the usual image\\n  processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil\\n  exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\\n\\n  Feature description\\n\\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\\n\\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\\n\\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\\n  ``filters\\'\\'.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\\n\\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]\\n\\n  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives\\n  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in\\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional\\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS\\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of\\n  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other \\n  palettes can be generated.\\n\\n\\nSupported functions include such niceties as the following:\\n\\no  image & image: + - / * interpolation\\no  image & constant: + - / *\\no  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,\\n   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.\\no  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or\\n   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.\\no  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,\\n   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp\\n   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.

The assertion\\nthat the village common on which the village depends for food belongs to\\nan invader simply because no individual has title is clearly an\\nexcuse.

If I forgot or botched your\\nfavorite acronym, please let me know!  Also, if there\\'s an acronym *not*\\non this list that confuses you, drop me a line, and if I can figure\\nit out, I\\'ll add it to the list.\\n\\nNote that this is intended to be a reference for *frequently seen*\\nacronyms, and is most emphatically *not* encyclopedic.  If I incorporated\\nevery acronym I ever saw, I\\'d soon run out of disk space!  :-)\\n\\nThe list will be posted at regular intervals, every 30 days.  All\\ncomments regarding it are welcome; I\\'m reachable as bradfrd2@ncar.ucar.edu.\\n\\nNote that this just tells what the acronyms stand for -- you\\'re on your\\nown for figuring out what they *mean*!  Note also that the total number of\\nacronyms in use far exceeds what I can list; special-purpose acronyms that\\nare essentially always explained as they\\'re introduced are omitted.\\nFurther, some acronyms stand for more than one thing; as of Edition 3 of\\nthe list, these acronyms appear on multiple lines, unless they\\'re simply\\ndifferent ways of referring to the same thing.\\n\\nThanks to everybody who\\'s sent suggestions since the first version of\\nthe list, and especially to Garrett A. Wollman (wollman@griffin.uvm.edu),\\nwho is maintaining an independent list, somewhat more verbose in\\ncharacter than mine, and to Daniel Fischer (dfi@specklec.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de),\\nwho is maintaining a truly HUGE list (535 at last count) of acronyms and\\nterms, mostly in German (which I read, fortunately).\\n\\nSpecial thanks this time to Ken Hollis at NASA, who sent me a copy of NASA\\nReference Publication 1059 Revised: _Space Transportation System and\\nAssociated Payloads: Glossary, Acronyms, and Abbreviations_, a truly\\nmammoth tome -- almost 300 pages of TLAs.\\n\\nSpecial Bonus!  At the end of this posting, you will find a perl program\\nwritten by none other than Larry Wall, whose purpose is to scramble the\\nacronym list in an entertaining fashion.

That\\nis, $3,000 - $5,999. \\n\\n\\nSource: 'International Economics: Theory and Policy' by Paul R.\\n        Krugman and Maurice Obstfeld, Harper Collins Publishers,\\n        1991, (second edition).\\n\\nIn terms of 'Annual Output Per Person in Dollars Adjusted to \\nPurchasing Power Parity,' Greece is in the same category with \\nTurkiye.\\n\\n\\nIndeed, Greek Governments have enormous problems to tackle. The \\neconomy is in shambles, corruption is rampant, air pollution is \\nin outrageous dimensions, state-sponsored terrorism is the name \\nof the game and infrastructure is decaying. Another insightful \\narticle in the New York Times (Sunday, April 7) exposes the dirty \\nlinen of Greece, and describes her as the pariah of the European \\nCommunity. The article reports that ''...with un-European antics,\\nGreece uses the Community as a cash register. She squanders, and\\nat times even steals the European tax payers' money for political  \\nfeatherbedding at home. The principal members of the Community\\nadmit that it was a mistake to accept Greece to the European\\nCommunity.'' This affirmation is testimony to the fact that\\nnotwithstanding her geographic location, Greece is un-European\\nin mentality and attitude. \\n\\nIndeed, during the last 12 years, Turkiye registered a great \\nsuccess with regard to economic restructuring. A sound economy, \\nready to be integrated to the world economies, has emerged, \\nsucceeding to the faltering one, witnessed in the '70s.\\n\\nJust 12 years ago, Greece used to export double as much as \\nTurkiye did. Now inversely, Turkiye's overall exports exceed \\nby far that of Greece. As far as the tourism incomes are \\nconcerned, we are witnessing the same phenomenon.\\n\\nThe governments in Turkiye have put a particular emphasis on \\nthe infrastructure investments (rather than investing in\\nworld terrorist organizations), thereby solving this issue \\ncompletely. Indeed, in the '70s, it was out of the question \\nto conduct a telephone call from Eastern Anatolia to the West. \\nNowadays, this is not the case at all, and in a far remote \\ntown, even in a village you may have, at any time, a long-distance \\ncall to any given country.\\n\\nHowever, the same could not be applied to Greece. In fact,\\nit is not so easy in Athens to have a trunk call to Germany\\nround the clock. And if you happen to be in the Greek islands,\\nthen your chance will be pretty slim. Therefore, it would not\\nbe an exaggeration to argue that Turkiye is far ahead of \\nGreece in regard to telecommunication facilities. Greece,\\nby virtue of its full membership, has enjoyed all advantages\\nof the EC, obtaining huge grants and extensive subsidies. \\nTurkiye, having no access at all to similar financial supports,\\nhas nevertheless managed to create a better economy which \\nenabled it to produce consecutive current accounts surplus\\nover the last two years. As such, Turkiye deserves to be the\\nonly country in its region having permanent current accounts\\nsurplus. \\n\\n\\nSerdar Argic\",\n",

In 1919 Albania  took 50 Macedonian\\nvillages. The part under  Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in\\n1991  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia.  There are  1.5\\nmillion Macedonians in the Republic; 500,000 in Bulgaria; 150,000\\nin Albania; and 300,000 in Serbia proper.\\n\\n  Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonian\\nhuman rights in  Greece, and lost his job as  a forestry worker a\\nfew years ago.  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island in\\nthe mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forced\\nthe Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town of\\nFlorina (Lerin) in Northern  Greece (Aegean Macedonia), where the\\nmajority of ethnic Macedonians live.\\n\\n  Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial in\\nwhich  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent,\\nespecially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for its\\nnorthern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia.\\n\\n  Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemned\\nGreece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (who\\nlargely live in Western Thrace). But it remains to be seen if the\\nUS government  will do anything until  the Presidential elections\\nare over.\\n\\nSerdar Argic',\n",

Furthermore, you even deny the \\nobvious. There was a genocide of the Muslims carried out by order of \\nthe fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government. Massacres of Muslims must be \\nstudied in detail, because they are the first modern example of the \\nhorrible crime of genocide. Blame must be apportioned to the Armenians\\nand their supporters for the murder of Muslims. The Turkish historic \\nhomeland, emptied of its native population until today, remains occupied \\nby the x-Soviet Armenian Government. Today, x-Soviet Armenia covers up \\nthe genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory \\nto this crime against humanity. x-Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime \\nof genocide against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making \\nreparations to the Turks and Kurds.\\n\\nThe following are the Jewish and Armenian sources on the cold-blooded\\ngenocide perpetrated by the x-Soviet Armenian Government against 2.5\\nmillion Muslim people between 1914 and 1920.

TORTURE.\\n\\n/* Written  4:41 pm  Apr 16, 1993 by cpr@igc.apc.org in igc:mideast.forum */\\n/* ---------- \"From Israeli press. TORTURE.\" ---------- */\\nFROM THE ISRAELI PRESS.\\n\\nNewspaper: Ma\\'ariv Date: 18. December 1992 Author: Avi Raz\\n\\nSubject: Torture\\n\\nTitle of article: Moderate physical pressure\\n\\nSeveral times in the course of the long hours in the interrogation\\nroom in Tulkarm prison, during which he says he was humiliated,\\nbeaten and tortured, Omar Daoud Jaber heard his interrogator, a\\nShabak agent \\'Captain Louis\\', chatting on the phone with his wife.\\n\"At those moments\", Omar said, \"I felt that he was like a\\nhumanbeing, but right after he finished talking, he would be beat\\nme and say, \\'You listened to the conversation and enjoyed\\nyourself\\' and I understood that he was not really a human being\".\\n\\nIn late October 1992, after 38 days in detention at Tulkarm\\nprison, Omar Jaber was released without charges. \"Among the Jews,\\nas among the Arabs, there are good people and bad people\", he said\\nafter his release, \"but there, in Tulkarm, in the interrogations\\nrooms, you cannot find even one person about whom you can say that\\nhe is a human being\". Although he left the detention installation\\nin Tulkarm bruised and humiliated (\"I sat at home for ten days. My\\nhands shook from nerves\"), one may consider Omar Jaber lucky: He\\ngot out, not so healthy, but entire, and even ultimately returned\\nto normal functioning, at the small solar heater plant he owns.\\n\\nIn contrast, Hassan Bader al-Zbeidi, for example, was released\\nseven weeks ago from detention in Tulkarm after 33 days in the\\nShabak wing, cut off from his surroundings. He doesn\\'t speak or\\nreact. Mustafa Barakat, aged only 23, who was arrested in early\\nAugust and was brought to the Tulkarm detention installation, left\\nit one day later - dead. \"We have recently received an especially\\nlarge number of testimonies concerning cruel tortures employed at\\nthe Tulkarm detention installation by Shabak interrogators\", noted\\nDr. Niv Gordon, director of the Association of Israel and\\nPalestinian Physicians for Human Rights. (...)\\n\\nThe right to complain against the Shabak does not excite Anan\\nSaber Makhlouf, a 20 year old student. In fact, he was extremely\\nfearful about describing the manner in which he was interrogated\\nin Tulkarm prison, in case the publication in the paper would\\nreturn him to detention and lead to renewed mistreatment.\\n\\n(...follow description of tortures....)\\n\\nOmar, a tall bearded man, was silent. \"I do not want to talk about\\nit\", he finally said, quietly. Some time later, embarrased and\\nashamed, he spoke: \"Sometimes he beats you and beats you until\\nyou\\'ll kiss his hand, and not only his hand. Even the hands of\\nanother interrogator, and another, whom he calls into the room,\\nlater if I want, you will kiss my ass.\"\\n\\nThese things take place in an Israeli army detention installation,\\nlocated within the military government compound in Tulkarm (West\\nBank). But the Shabak interrogation wing is a separate kingdom. In\\nearly March the IDF allowed representatives of B\\'Tselem, the\\nIsraeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Territories, to\\nvisit Tulkarm prison, but denied them access to the interrogation\\nwing. \"The interrogation wing is Shabak property, being solely\\nunder Shabak responsibility. All interrogations are performed by\\nit\", said Lieutnant Sharon Sho\\'an, the commander of the\\ninstallation, according to the internal report written by B\\'tselem\\nmember, Yuval Ginbar, following the visit. Major David Pe\\'er,\\ngoverning commander of the prison system in the Central Command,\\nwas quoted in the report:  \"There is an ethical problem here - no\\none can enter the interrogation wing\".',\n",

       " ' (excerpts from posting on this topic) \\n\\n\\n(I\\'ve seen satellites at midnight - they\\'re not only in twilight.) :o) \\n\\n\\nNow my comments: \\n\\nI\\'d like to add that some of the \"protests\" do not come from a strictly \\npractical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for \\nresearch activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I \\nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may \\nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \\nunsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars \\nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \\na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \\n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \\nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \\nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \\nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \\nin an afterlife.  \\n\\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \\nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \\ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \\nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \\nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \\nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \\nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \\n\\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \\nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \\ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \\nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \\nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \\ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \\nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \\n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \\none weekend, \"getting away from it all\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \\nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \\nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \\nmiles to the east.  (Their \\'security light\\' didn\\'t help matters \\nmuch either.)  But I\\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \\nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \\n\\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\\'t \\nfouled in some way.  (I mean they\\'ve been TRYING this forever - \\nlike, concerning Tesla\\'s idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don\\'t watch \\ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \\ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \\nIf ya\\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \\nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \\n\\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \\nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \\n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \\nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.

According to the report, Israel is\\nexpected to offer the Palestinians new proposals regarding the\\nauthority of the Palestinian Executive Council, general elections,\\ncontrol over land and human rights issues in the Territories.\\nIsrael will express its readiness to give the Palestinians control\\nof more land than previously offered. According to the radio\\nreport, one estimate is that Israel will give the Palestinians\\ncontrol over as much as two thirds of the administered lands, as\\nwell as broad authority on water issues. Israel will seek to\\npromote its offer to hold elections in the Territories in hopes of\\nstrengthening the position of the Palestinian delegation to the\\npeace negotiations. According to Israel Radio, the Israeli\\ndelegation to the bilateral talks with the Palestinians will offer\\ngreater responsibilities to the Palestinian Executive Council\\nallowing it certain legislative capabilities, without making it a\\nsymbol for Palestinian sovereignty. U.S. Secretary of State Warren\\nChristopher invited all the heads of delegations to a gathering\\ntonight. It will be the first such event since the Madrid\\nconference.

       " '\\n    First of all (this is NOT a snide response), if you\\'re confused about\\nthis issue, you will stumble over a lot of other things as well.  I suggest\\nthat the weakness is your reference material.  Get \"An Introduction to Ray\\nTracing\" by Andrew Glassner for very good coverage of the raytracing\\nalgorithm.  You could also refer to the 2nd edition of Foley & Van Dam.\\n\\n    On to the question.  The simple answer is that you just keep adding up\\nall the contributions and then clamping at the maximum intensity.  For\\nexample, if your intensity values range from 0.0 to 1.0, then keep adding up\\nand clamp the resultant values to 1.0 (you might have to clamp the lower\\nbound to 0.0 if you have dark bulbs, but that\\'s another issue =^).  So, you\\nget some illumination equation like this:\\n\\n        I = Lambient + Ldiffuse(light[n]) + Lreflected + Ltransparent\\n\\n    The contribution due to reflection is just summed with the light\\nintensity, as is the light due to transparency.  Now, a slightly less\\nhand-waving illumination equation is this:\\n\\n        I = KaLa + KdLd(light[n]) + KrLr + KtLt\\n\\n    That is, each component of the illumination equation is governed by the\\nmaterial constants Ka, Kd, Kr and Kt.  So the maximum you can get from\\ntransparency for a given object, for example, might be [0.4, 0.1, 0.5] for a\\npurple-colored glass object.\\n\\n    Hopefully this answers your question.

Features\\n===========\\n\\nDMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC:\\n\\n\\n - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard\\n   (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported)\\n\\n - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display\\n\\n - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA)\\n\\n - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale\\n\\n - color-space selection\\n\\n - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required\\n\\n - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic)\\n\\n - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for\\n   VGA and many Super-VGAs\\n\\n...\\n\\n4. Technical information\\n========================\\n\\nThe player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].\\nThe IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2]\\n(not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero\\ncoefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT\\n(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'\\nalgorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main\\ndifference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported\\nalgorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to\\nuse a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation\\ndominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of\\nthe dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).\\n\\nRestricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to\\n+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed\\nover this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points\\nis thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the\\nexpense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.\\n\\nSaturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying\\nsomewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated\\nby primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of\\nconstant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the\\nlower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than\\nto hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve\\non NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish\\nareas.\\n\\n...\\n\",\n",

       " \"Intro to ACCESS.bus (RE: the ACCESS.bus Software Creator's \\n\\tContest Announcement)\\n\\nWHAT IS ACCESS.bus?\\n\\nACCESS.bus is a new open industry standard for computer \\nperipheral connectivity.  ACCESS.bus is a serial protocol that \\nuses simple, low-cost I2C technology to link multiple devices to \\na single PC port.  Peripheral devices such as keyboards or \\nkeypads, locators (Mice, Trackballs, Joysticks), printers, VR \\ngloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and \\nothers can be easily daisy chained to the host PC.  Applications \\nsuch as CAD/CAM, Data Acquisition, Simulation, Virtual Reality, \\nMultiple-Player/Single PC Games, Education and many, many more \\ncan now take advantage of ACCESS.bus, the technology that puts \\nPlug and Play on every PC.\\n\\nThe ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of \\nsystems and peripherals.  Multiple devices connect to the host \\ncomputer with only one port.  Common communication methods for a \\nnumber of device types lead to simplified hardware and software \\ndevelopment.  As an open standard, ACCESS.bus enables cross-\\nplatform use of the same device.\\n\\nACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION:\\n=====================================\\n\\nACCESS.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone \\nto implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without \\nfee or royalty.\\nACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture.  That is, a single \\nhost can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices.  ACCESS.bus \\ndata rate is 100 Kbits/sec.\\n\\nACCESS.bus Physical Layer\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on I2C hardware \\nprotocol, with one data line and one clock line.\\nStandard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level \\nhandshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock \\nsynchronization.  \\n\\nACCESS.bus Software Protocols\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nThe ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three \\nlevels: I2C Protocol, Base Protocol, and Application Protocol.\\n\\nI2C PROTOCOL: This simple and efficient protocol defines \\narbitration among contending masters without losing data.  I2C \\nprovides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with \\ndifferent clock rates.  Bus transactions include addressing, \\nframing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the \\nreceiver.  \\n\\nBASE PROTOCOL: Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between \\na host computer and multiple peripherals.  The host becomes the \\nACCESS.bus manager.  The Base Protocol defines the format of an \\nACCESS.bus message envelope, which is an I2C bus transaction with \\nadditional semantics, including checksum.\\nUnique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot \\nplugging.  Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus \\naddresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches.  Hot \\nplugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the \\nsystem is running, without rebooting.\\n\\nAPPLICATION PROTOCOL: This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus \\nprotocol which defines message semantics specific to particular \\ntypes of devices.  Each type requires a different Application \\nProtocol.  Three broad device types have been identified: \\nkeyboards, locators, and text devices.\\n\\nACCESS.bus support on the PC\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nAll three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the \\nPC.  An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the \\nbase protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices.  \\nAn ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1 \\n- controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with \\nthe ACCESS.bus device drivers.  Drivers are available for \\nmultiple ACCESS.bus keyboards, locators and printers for DOS and \\nWindows 3.1.  Also available are C language source code examples \\nof the interface from applications to the device drivers.\\n\\n\\nTo Contact ABIG (the ACCESS.bus Industry Group):\",\n",

I don\\'t know much about panda \"thumbs\", so I\\'ll ask\\nis it opposable?\\n\\n\\nWell I won\\'t say flat out that they can\\'t be intelligent, but I\\'ll\\nbring a couple of lines of argument to bear to try to show why I\\ndon\\'t think it\\'s likely. First let me say that when I say \"intelligent\"\\nI mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level\\nwith, or greater than, human tool use and tool building. IE assuming\\nsuitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter \\nit\\'s enviroment in a planned way, it will do so. That\\'s certainly not\\na universal or complete definition of intelligence, but it will suffice\\nfor a putative technological alien.\\n\\nNow no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought, but\\nit\\'s generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level\\nof complexity. This is generally determined by the number of neuron\\ncells, and their interconnections. So a creature the size of a lemur\\nwouldn\\'t have enough neurons to support complex thought. This argument\\nis considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur. There\\'s room\\nfor a large brain, though no indication that one ever developed. One\\nreason this may be true is neuronic speed. The electrochemical messages \\nthat trigger neurons require time to propagate. This makes it difficult\\nfor a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very\\nlarge creatures. So there\\'s little selection pressure for such brains.\\nInstead, a simpler distributed network evolves. This doesn\\'t rule out\\nintelligent dinosaurs, but it points in that direction.\\n\\nThen there are the thermodynamic arguments. A tiny creature like the\\nlemur needs to eat frequently because it\\'s internal heat is rapidly\\nlost due to it\\'s high surface to volume ratio. I contend that a creature\\nthat must spend most of it\\'s time and energy feeding won\\'t have the time\\nto develop and exercise intelligence. That argument may be somewhat weak.\\nThe dinosaur\\'s problem is the reverse, it must moderate it\\'s heat production \\nbecause it\\'s high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat. \\nI\\'m assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical\\nreactivity reasons for productive neuron function. So creatures would\\ntend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that\\nof humans if they are carbon based. That tends to rule out cold blooded\\ncreatures as potential homes of intelligence. Some people contend that\\nsome of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded. But for a creature\\nthe size of a brontosaur, it\\'s activity levels would have to be restrained\\nor it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the\\nwaste heat. Whales are similar size, but they can reject heat to the\\nocean, a much more efficient sink than air. I suspect that for intelligence\\nto manifest itself, a certain degree of activity in interacting with the\\nenvironment is necessary. IE monkey curiousity. I doubt a large dinosaur\\nwould be capable of that much activity.\\n\\nGary',\n",

Others steered clear of such puzzle books because \\nthey were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern \\nmathematics and didn\\'t mind saying for all the world to hear that they didn\\'t \\nknow how to solve mere arithmetic problems. Professional mathematicians were \\nno exception. Here\\'s what the Russian mathematician Alexander Khinchin, a \\nspecialist in statistics, wrote about arithmetic: \"I willingly confess that \\nany time a fifth-grader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem, it was\\na hard work for me, and sometimes I failed completely. Of course, like most of \\nmy friends, I could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route\\n--constructing equations or sets of equations. But we were supposed to avoid \\nusing algebraic analysis at all costs! . . . By the way, it\\'s a fact that is \\nwell known and oft repeated that, as a rule, neither high school graduates, \\nnor students at teaching colleges, nor teachers beginning their careers\\n(nor, I must add, scientific researchers) can solve arithmetic problems. It \\nseems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifth-grade \\nteachers.\"\\n\\nNow, I\\'m not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the \\nbookbag of anyone flying into space. But a sense of justice induces me to \\nrecommend one particular problem book, one that will satisfy the most \\nfastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a \\nrelatively short flight to the Moon but for a extended space voyage--say, to\\nVenus and back.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tOne for the \"road\"\\n\\n\\tThey both took out the books they brought for the road.

They are as inseparable from the image of Armenia as the elegant \\nletters of the Armenian alphabet, invented by Mesrop Mashtots, or the songs of \\nKomitas, or the paintings of Saryan.\\n\\nAn edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a \\nbibliographic rarity. It was published under the title Problems and Solutions\\nof Vardapet [1] Anania of Shirak, Armenian Mathematician of the Seventh \\nCentury (translated and published by I. A. Orbeli, Petrograd, 1918).\\n\\nThe abundance of close observations and wide-ranging information about the way \\nof life and customs of that remote epoch when Anania of Shirak lived and \\nworked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book. For many years \\nthe book was known only to researchers in the humanities--specialists in \\nArmenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldn\\'t let just\\nanyone see it. Even now, after research by K. P. Patkanov, the learned monk \\nFather Kaloust, J.I. Orbeli, A. Abramyan, V. K. Chaloyan, and others has \\nbrought the works of Anania of Shirak to light in scholarly circles, the \\ngeneral reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable \\nproblem book.\\n\\n\\t\\tVardapet Anania of Shirak\\n\\n\\tOnce fell in love with the art of calculation, I thought that no \\n\\tphilosophical notion can be constructed without number, considering \\n\\tit the mother of all wisdom.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t--Anania of Shirak\\n\\nAmong ancient Armenian thinkers, Vardapet Anania of Shirak stands out because \\nof the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his \\nwork. Some of his works have been preserved. In addition to the Problems and\\nSolutions, the following tracts have found a special place in the estimation\\nof scholars: On Weights and Measures, Cosmography and Calendrical Theory, and\\nArmenian Geography of the Seventh Century A.D. (the authorship of the last\\nwork was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient Armenia, \\nMovses of Khoren).\\n\\nIn his autobiography, Anania of Shirak has this to say about himself:\\n\\n\\tI, Anania of Shirak, having studied all the science of our\\n\\tArmenian land and having learned the Holy Scripture intimately, \\n\\tin the expression of the psalmist, \"every day I illuminated the \\n\\teyes of my mind.\" Feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation,\\n\\tI came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy, \\n\\tthe mother of all sciences, without number. I could find in Armenia \\n\\tneither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the \\n\\tsciences. I therefore went to Greece and met in Theodosiople a man \\n\\tnamed Iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works. He told me\\n\\tthat in Forth Armenia [2] there lived a famous mathematician,\\n\\tChristosatur. I went this person and spent six months with him. But \\n        soon I noticed that Christosatur was a master not of all science but \\n        only of certain fragmentary facts.\\n\\n\\tI then went to Constantinople, where I met acquaintances who told me: \\n\\t\"Why did you go so far, when much closer to us, in Trebizon, on the \\n\\tcoast of Pontus [3] lives the Byzantine vardapet Tyukhik. He is full \\n\\tof wisdom, is known to kings, and knows Armenian literature.\" I asked \\n\\tthem how they knew this. They answered: \"We saw ourselves that many \\n\\tpeople traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man. \\n\\tIndeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of Constantinople,\\n\\tPhilagrus, traveled with us, bringing many young persons to become \\n\\tpupils of Tyukhik.\" When I heard this, I expressed my gratitude to \\n\\tGod, who had quenched the thirst of His slave.\\n\\n\\tI went to Tyukhik at the monastery of St. Eugene and explained why I \\n\\tHe sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of St. \\n\\tGregory; I am glad that all your country will learn from me. I myself \\n\\tlived in Armenia for many years as a youth. Ignorance reigned there.\" \\n\\tVardapet Tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with \\n\\tme. The Lord bestowed upon me His blessing: I completely assimilated \\n\\tthe science of number, and with such success that my fellow students\\n\\tat the king\\'s court began to envy me.\\n\\n\\tI spent eight years with Tyukhik and studied many books that had not \\n\\tbeen translated into our language. For the vardapet had an innumerable \\n\\tcollection of books: secret and explicit, ecclesiastical and pagan, \\n\\tbooks on art, history, and medicine, books of chronologies. Why \\n\\tenumerate them by title? In a word, there is no book that Tyukhik did \\n\\tnot have. And he had such a gift from the Holy Spirit for translating\\n\\tthat when he sat down to translate something from the Greek into \\n\\tArmenian, he did not struggle as other translators did, and the \\n\\ttranslation read as if the work were written in that language \\n\\toriginally.\\n\\n\\tTyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had \\n\\tlearned the Armenian language. \"When I was young,\" he said, \"I lived \\n\\tin Trebizon, at the court of the military chief Ioannus Patricus, and \\n\\tfor a long time, up to the accession of Mauritius to the throne I \\n\\tserved as a military man in Armenia and learned your language and \\n\\tliterature. During one attack by Persian troops on the Greeks, I was \\n\\twounded and escaped to Antioch. I lost all my possessions. Praying to \\n\\tthe Lord to heal my wounds, I made a promise: \"If You prolong my life, \\n\\tI shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to \\n\\tcollecting treasures of knowledge.\" And the Lord heard my prayers. \\n\\tAfter I recovered I went to Jerusalem, and from there to Alexandria \\n\\tand Rome. Upon returning to Constantinople, I met a famous philosopher \\n\\tfrom Athens and studied with him for many years. After that I returned \\n\\tto my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people.\"\\n\\n\\tAfter some years that philosopher died. Not finding a replacement for \\n\\thim, the king and his courtiers sent for Tyukhik and invited him to \\n\\tassume the teacher\\'s position. Tyukhik, citing the promise he made to \\n\\tGod not to move far from the city, turned down the offer. But because\\n\\tof his wide leaning, people came streaming from all countries to study \\n\\twith him.\\n\\n\\tAnd I, the most insignificant of all Armenians, having learned from \\n\\thim this powerful science, desired by kings, brought it to our \\n\\tcountry, supported by no one, obligated only to my own industry, God\\'s \\n\\thelp, and the prayers of the Blessed Educator. And no one thanked me \\n\\tfor my efforts.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProblems and Solutions\\n\\n\\tA half and one sixth and one nine-ninth of all the books were printed\\n\\ton verge\\'; one fifth and one two-hundred-eighty-fifth--on rag paper; \\n\\tone forty-fifth and one eight-hundred-fifty-fifth--on vellum, and \\n\\tforty-five inscribed copies--on Dutch paper. And so, find how many \\n\\tcopies were printed in all.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t--Imitation of Anania of Shirak\\n\\nA Latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli (\"books have their own fate\").\\nThe fate of Problems and Solutions by Anania of Shirak is quite amazing. The\\nmanuscripts of Anania\\'s book were preserved only because, according to \\nArmenian historians, \"in ancient and medieval Armenia manuscripts were guarded \\nfrom invaders, like weapons, and cherished, like one\\'s own children.\" Biding\\ntheir time, the manuscripts lay in the Matenadaran, a renowned depository of \\nancient manuscripts (now the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts).\\nAnd its hour finally arrived. In 1896 the learned monk Father Kaloust used two \\nmanuscripts to publish the problem book, supplementing it with an introduction \\nand commentary. In 1918 the book was translated into Russian, edited, \\nannotated, and typeset by Iosef Orbeli, a prominent scholar (and later a \\nmember of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR).\\n\\nIn the translator\\'s words, the problems of Anania are \"amusing, full of life, \\nand simple.\" Orbeli goes on to say: \"The subjects of the problems are \\ngenerally taken from everyday life. The scene is predominantly his homeland \\nShirak and the surrounding countryside, and the dramatis personae, if they are \\nnamed, are the local princes--the Kamsarakans, including Nersekh, who was a \\ncontemporary of Anania.\" Like other ancient authors, Anania of Shirak used \\nonly \"aliquots\" -- that is, fractions with a numerator of 1. When it is\\nnecessary to write fractions with numerators other than 1, one has to \\nrepresent it as a sum of aliquots (see the epigraph above).\\n\\nLike any true work of art, the problems of Anania suffer terribly in the \\nretelling. You have to read the originals (albeit in translation) in their \\nfull glory. So let\\'s open Anania\\'s problem book--a gift from across the ages.\\n\\nProblems 1 and 8 relate to the Armenian uprising against the Persians in A.D. \\n572.\\n\\nProblem 1\\n\\nMy father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the \\nArmenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed extraordinary \\nheroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the Persian troops. \\nThe first time, he struck down half of the Persian army. The second time, \\npursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers. The third \\ntime, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army. The Persians who were \\nstill alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to Nakhichevan. And so, from \\nthis remainder, find how many Persian soldiers there were before the massacre.\\n\\nProblem 8\\n\\nDuring the famous Armenian uprising against the Persians, when Zaurak\\nKamsarakan killed Suren, one of the Armenian azats[4] sent an envoy to the\\nPersian king to report the baleful news. The envoy covered fifty miles in a \\nday. Fifteen days later, when he learned of this, Zaurak Kamsarakan sent \\nriders in pursuit to bring the envoy back. The riders covered eighty miles in \\na day. And so, find how many days it took them to catch the envoy.\\n\\nProblem 18 mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal. In the Russian \\ntranslation, they are all called \"dishes.\" But in the original Armenian, \\naccording to Orbeli\\'s note, the dishes in the first and second instances are \\ncalled mesur, and in the third instance scutel. Scutel is a common Armenian \\nword, but mesur had not been encountered in Armenian literature before \\nAnania\\'s Problems and Solutions.\\n\\nProblem 18\\n\\nThere was a tray in my house. I melted it down and made other vessels from the \\nmetal. From one third I made a mesur; from one fourth, another mesur; from\\none fifth, two goblets; from one sixth, two scutels; and from two hundred ten \\ndrams, I made a bowl. And now, find the weight of the tray.\\n\\nSeveral of the problems reflect the richness of the Caucasian fauna in \\nAnania\\'s time -- for instance, problem 7.\\n\\nProblem 7\\n\\nOnce I was in Marmet, the capital of the Kamsarakans. Strolling along the bank \\nof the river Akhuryan, I saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast. \\nWe caught a half and a quarter of the school, and all the fishes that slipped\\nout of the net ended up in a creel. When I looked in the creel, I found \\nforty-five fishes. And now, find how many fishes here were in all.\\n\\nThe temptation is great to present all 24 problems. But I\\'ll restrain myself\\nand offer you just one more.\\n\\nProblem 20 provides some interesting information about the wild animals that \\ninhabited Armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is no\\nmention of them even in zoological reference books. The wild donkey, according \\nto the generally accepted view, never roamed the Armenian lands. Yet Anania of \\nShirak offers evidence to the contrary .\\n\\nProblem 20\\n\\nThe hunting preserve of Nersekh Kamsarakan, ter[5] of Shirak and Asharunik, \\nwas at the base of the mountain called Artin. One night great herds of wild\\ndonkey entered the preserve. The hunters could not cope with the donkeys and, \\nrunning to the village of Talin, told Nersekh about them. When he arrived with\\nhis brothers and azats and entered the preserve, they began killing the wild \\nbeasts. Half of the animals were caught in traps, one fourth were killed by \\narrows. The young, which constituted one twelfth of all the animals, were \\ncaught alive, and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears. And \\nso, find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre.\\n\\n\\t\\t\"Set in type by me, Iosef Orbeli\"\\n\\n\\tHis biography could not be squeezed into the framework of a \\n\\tbibliography.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t-- K Uzbashyan, Academician\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIosef Abgarovich Orbeli\\n\\nAnyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy (1/n of the small printing--n is the \\nsolution to the epigraph in the previous section) of the Russian translation \\nof Anania of Shirak\\'s Problems and Solutions, a thin book with yellowed pages,\\nhas probably noticed the variety of the fonts, the elegance of the borders, \\nand the high quality of the design, printing, and binding. Such great \\nattention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for \\na degree in bookmaking. And this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma \\nattesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it. An \\nadvertisement at the end of the book reads: \"This book was typeset in \\nDecember 1917 at the printing offices of the Russian Academy of Sciences by \\nme, Iosef Orbeli; the text was also proofread, laid out, and decorated with \\nborders by me. Various circumstances prevented me from carrying this project \\nto the end; the final pages of the book were typeset by M. Strolman.\"\\n\\nTypesetting was neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned \\norientalist Iosef Orbeli, who later became the director of the Hermitage \\nMuseum in Leningrad. He was also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith. Orbeli had \\nalready become acquainted with the famous academic printing house Typis \\nAcademiae, founded in 1728 and known all over the scientific world for its \\nrich collection of fonts and its virtuoso typesetters. In preparing to publish \\nthe corpus of ancient inscriptions preserved on the walls of Armenian \\nchurches, Orbeli found it necessary to create a new font that would preserve \\nthe unique signs and ligatures. This complicated work was done by M. G.\\nStrolman. (Unfortunately the entire set of letters was destroyed during the \\nblockade of Leningrad in World War II.)\\n\\nWhen Orbeli came to the printing offices of the Academy of Sciences, times \\nwere hard. The only way to publish the newly translated Problems of Anania\\nwas for Orbeli to learn typesetting (he had always been attracted to the \\nprinter\\'s craft). In 1922 Orbeli became the director of printing at the \\nAcademy of Sciences. Even after he retired, he remained a tireless champion\\nof Russian academic typography.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tBack to Earth\\n\\n\\tThis book by definition does not exhaust all the most important \\n\\tworks in this domain.

AIRPORT\\n\\n    ESPIONAGE: Former police officer is taken into custody upon\\n    arriving from Philippines, where he had fled after FBI\\n    interrogation.\\n\\nBy Jenifer Warren, Times staff writer\\n\\nSan Francisco -- A former San Francisco police officer who fled to the\\nPhilippines amid accusations that he funneled confidential law\\nenforcement information to an investigator for the Anti-Defamation\\nLeague was arrested at the airport here on 11 felony charges, police\\nsaid Friday.\\n\\nThomas J. Gerard who abruptly left the United States in October after\\nthe FBI questioned him about his activities, was apprehended Thursday\\nnight after a source in the Philippines told investigators that Gerard\\nwas returning home.\\n\\nGerard, 50, was booked into San Francisco County Jail early Friday\\nmorning on eight counts of theft of government documents and one count\\neach of computer theft, burglary and conspiracy.\\n\\nIf convicted on all charges, Gerard could face 16 years in prison and\\n$40,000 in fines.  Bail was initially set at $250,000 after police\\nargued that he was a flight risk, but it was later reduced to $20,000. \\nA friend of Gerard was trying to post bail late Friday afternoon, a\\nsheriff\\'s spokeswoman said.\\n\\nGerard returned to the United because he missed his wife and child,\\nwith whom he lived on a houseboat in Sausalito, and \"wanted to have\\nhis day in court,\" said Police Capt. John Willett, his former boss and\\none of two arresting officers.\\n\\nGerard, an undercover agent for the Central Intelligence Agency from\\n1982 to 1985, also feared that the CIA was out to kill him, Willett\\nsaid.  In an interview with The Times last month, Gerard threatened to\\ndisclose illegal CIA support of death squads in Central America if he\\nwas indicted and tried on the San Francisco spying charges.\\n\\nGerard is a central figure in a scandal over an intelligence network\\noperated by the Anti-Defamation League, a prominent Jewish civil\\nrights organization.  Investigators allege that Gerard illegally gave\\ncriminal histories to Roy Bullock, a San Francisco art dealer who said\\nhe has been an undercover ADL intelligence operative for 40 years.\\n\\nInvestigators said they found confidential police files in Bullock\\'s\\nhome computer -- which contained entries on 10,000 people and 950\\ngroups -- and in boxes in his apartment.  Files have also been seized\\nunder search warrants from ADL offices in San Francisco and Los\\nAngeles but authorities have not disclosed their contents.\\n\\nGerard could not be reached for comment Friday, and his attorney,\\nJames Lassart, did not return telephone calls seeking comment.  In the\\ninterview with The Times last month, however, Gerard acknowledged\\nsnooping and sharing some information with Bullock, but denied any\\ncriminal wrongdoing.\\n\\nBullock and Gerard also are under investigation for selling\\nintelligence to South Africa.\\n\\nADL officials have described Bullock as a $550-a-week independent\\ncontractor and have vigorously denied knowledge of any illegal\\nactivity.  On Friday, ADL lawyer Jerrold Ladar said Gerard\\'s arrest\\n\"has nothing to do with ADL.  Other than that, we have no comment on\\nthe case.\"\\n\\nArab-American groups -- which were a main target of the spying,\\naccording to police -- applauded the arrest and pressed authorities to\\npursue the investigation.\\n\\n\"We urge investigators to carry this case forward and to publicly\\ndisclose the full extent of ADL and law enforcement involvement,\" said\\nJames Zogby, head of the Arab American Institute in Washington.\\n\\nPolice, meanwhile, characterized Gerard\\'s arrest -- the first in the\\ninquiry into the spying scandal -- as an unexpected breakthrough.  A\\nformer police colleague of Gerard, Inspector Fred Mollat, visited\\nGerard several weeks ago and urged him to return home.\\n\\n\"I knew he wouldn\\'t want to live on an island on the lam forever, but\\nwe didn\\'t think it would happen this quickly,\" Capt. Willett said. \\n\"This development really speeds up our timetable on the case.\"\\n\\nDuring his 25-year career on the police force, Gerard was a highly\\nregarded officer known for his work in the department\\'s intelligence\\ndivision.  His last assignment was on the gang task force.\\n\\nAfter FBI agents questioned Gerard last fall, he took early retirement\\nand fled to the remote jungle island of Palawan, 300 miles south of\\nManila.\\n\\nGerard was arrested at 8:40 p.m. as he stepped from his Philippines\\nAirlines flight. He was traveling alone and looked tanned but haggard\\nafter his six-month hiatus, police said.\\n\\n\"He was surprised when he saw us standing there, and got a shocked\\nlook on his face,\" Willett said.  \"Then he said, \\'Hello, I\\'m back.\\'\"\\n ',\n",

Going into today's game, Deshaies was 3-0\\nwith a 1.74 ERA.  Deshaies allowed 2 Earned runs in 6 2/3 innings, meaning\\nhis ERA will climb slightly.  Deshaies, who came to MN via a trade with\\nPhiladelphia which sent David West there, continues to make Andy MacPhail\\nlook like a true genius.\\n\\nWillie Banks has put together two solid starts for the Twins, going 6.1 innings\\non Monday while coasting on solid Twins hitting.  Deshaies and Banks now \\ncombine for 6 of the Twins eight victories, while Tapani/Mahomes/Erickson are\\n0-5.\\n\\nWednesday's game marked the first opposing left-handed starting pitcher for the\\nTwins this year (Rickey Bones).  The Twins teed off against both him and \\nsubsequent relief, including a Grand Slam by Kent Hrbek which pushed the lead\\nto 7-3.  The Twins pitching staff could not hold the lead, though, allowing\\n4 walks in the 7th inning, 2 of which scored and coming with bases loaded.\\nTapani gave up one walk before being relieved, Guthrie two walks, and Mike\\nHartley one walk before the inning was over.  This tied the game at 7-7, and\\nthe Brew Crew rocked Mike Hartley for 3 runs in the top of the tenth to win\\nit.\\n\\nAguilera continues to be shaky against the Brew Crew.  6 of 20 career blown\\nsaves have come against the Brew Crew, and today's game was shaky as well.\\nComing into the ninth with a 5-2 lead, Aguilera gave up a solo HR to Vaughn,\\nthen hits to Darryl Hamilton and Dickie Thon before finally retiring the\\nside.  Once again, the tying run made it to second base on Aggie.\\nWeak hearted Twins fans are advised not to watch Aggie in the ninth.\\n\\nGeneral News\\n-------------------------------------\\nPedro Munoz continues to improve as an outfielder, playing in left field on\\nTuesday's game.  He continues to bat weakly against right handed pitching,\\nthough, which has limited his playing time.  Gene Larkin and JT Bruett(former\\nGopher) have been playing right field, as both can bat left handed.\\n\\nThe Twins begin a three game series with the Detroit Tigers tomorrow.  Starting\\nPitching is tentatively scheduled as Erickson, Mahomes, Banks.  The Detroit\\nTigers have had TWO 20 run games in the last ten days, and should provide \\nquite a challenge to the young MN pitching staff.\\n\\nThe Twins have 9 HR's this year, three each from Puckett, Hrbek, and Winfield,\\nthe third, fourth, and fifth batters, respectively.\\n\\nBrian Harper pegged 4 of the first 6 baserunners attempting to steal second\\nthis year, and shows much improvement in this category.\\n\\nJim Deshaies has three pick-offs and one balk this year.  Some say he \\nhas the best 1st base move in baseball.  This move has enabled him to pitch\\nout of some tight early jams, and has certainly contributed to his 4-0 \\nstart.  Watch to see if umpiring crews began calling the balk more tightly\\nin response to opposing team complaints about his leg kicking behind the\\nrubber on the pick-off move.\\n\\n\\nCurrent MLB AL West Standings( from Joesph Hernandez, jtchern@ocb.berkeley.edu  )\",\n",

Being me, of course, I\\nused equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth,\\nand I calculated both rate of performance (fielding equivalent\\naverage) and total performance (fielding equivalent runs). But I\\ncompared, not to the average player, but the replacement player, and\\nhere\\'s why: because the positional adjustment comes built in to the\\nsystem. In the AL of 1992, the average SS is 32.9 runs above\\nreplacement (RAR); cf, 31.6; 2B, 28.8; 3B, 26.3; LF, 26.0; RF, 24.6;\\n1B, 16.9. We may quibble with the exact numbers, but the order looks\\nsubstantially right.\\n\\nIn the equivalent average, I have always set league average to .235. I\\nhad decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an eqa of\\n.180; the name of that replacement level hitter, often as not, is\\n\"Billy Ripken\". I decided to let the replacement level fielder be the\\nsame distance from .235 as .180, but in the opposite direction as I\\nhave set it up; that makes for an eqa of .280. (Yes, I can add. Runs\\nare proportional to eqa squared; the difference between 180 squared\\nand 235 squared equals the difference to 279 squared, and I rounded\\noff for simplicity). An all-replacement fielding team would have:\\nRandy Milligan at first (.282), Willie Randolph (.269) at second, Leo\\nGomez (.279) at third, Walt Weiss (.269) at short, Kevin Bass (.271)\\nin left, HoJo (.257) in center, and Eric Anthony (.277) in right. Ugh.\\n\\nSo, the total number of RAR for a player is the sum of his batting and\\nfielding RAR. I can rate them by total RAR, or RAR per some number of\\nbatting outs, like 400. An average player has a total RAR of about 55,\\n30 batting, 25 fielding.\\n\\nTotal RAR (bat/field)\\n\\n1. Bonds      152 (124/28)  Ventura    124 (66/58)\\n2.

Igor and I had thought that if it was \\na girl we would call her Raisa, after my mother-in-law, and if it was a boy, \\nwe\\'d call him Arsen, after Igor\\'s grandfather. I had a girl, and I, without\\nIgor, named her Raisa, in honor of her dead grandmother.\\n\\nOur family and the Melkumians had been neighbors since 1965. Igor and I grew \\nup together, we were friends from childhood on. We got engaged when I was 16. \\nIn 1981, when I was 18, we were married. Two children were born to us in \\nSumgait. My daughter is now 6 years old, her name is Kristina, and my son,\\nSeryozha, is four and a half.\\n\\nFirst I shall tell what happened on February 27. That day on my way home from \\nwork I passed Lenin Square, where about 1,500 people had gathered. There were \\nKomsomol members there, and Pioneers [Children\\'s organization], and there were \\nboth Party members and non-Party people there as well. All of them were \\nshouting, \"There\\'s no room for Christians here!\" and \"When we finish with the \\nArmenians, we\\'ll go after the Russians!\" And some even cried Out, \"Death to \\nthe Armenians!\" Absurd rumors had been circulating about town. I became \\nfrightened. I came home, breathless, and told about everything I had seen \\ndowntown. My family couldn\\'t believe it. My father-in-law Sogomon Markovich \\nMelkumian, wasn\\'t home, he was at an Azerbaijani wedding. By eight o\\'clock he \\nreturned and had barely finished parking the car when his rear window was \\nsmashed with a rock. He got out of the car but there was no one there. Well I \\nwas telling him everything, too, and he said, \"What, is there no longer any\\ngovernment?\" That same day Igor said, \"Papa, something terrible is happening \\nin the city.\" And he said, \"We\\'ll stay at home, no one will drive us from our \\nown home.\"\\n\\nThe day passed. On February 28, that was Sunday, we didn\\'t go out. We called \\nour relatives and asked them all kinds of questions, and they all said the \\nsame thing. Sometime around evening they started smashing the car of an \\nArmenian from the neighboring building. Ira, my brother-in-law\\'s wife, and I \\ncalled the police: they\\'re wrecking a car, help. We called and called, and \\nnonetheless they didn\\'t come and they didn\\'t do anything.\\n\\nOn February 29, on Monday, even though there were troops in the city, we were \\nafraid to go to work. I called the school: I had the keys to the classroom. I \\ntold the senior teacher that he should send someone for the keys, I wouldn\\'t \\nbe coming in. He agreed, and even said, \"Fine, don\\'t come in, we understand \\nwhat\\'s going on in town, don\\'t come in.\"\\n\\nBefore that, on the 28th, the Ambartsumian family came over. They came to my \\nfather-in-law and said, \"Uncle Sergey, they broke our windows, bad things are \\nhappening in town.\" Uncle Misha Ambartsumian even said, \"With my own eyes I \\nsaw them chasing naked girls through the streets. I don\\'t know,\" he said, \"we \\nshould leave town.\" Well on the 29th we were already trying to decide where we \\nshould go, thinking we\\'d go to our dacha. We got a couple of bags together, \\nclothes, food, the bare essentials. And then somewhere around 4:45 the \\nbuilding manager came by and said, \"Uncle Sergey, the situation in town is \\nbad, don\\'t go out.\" My father even opened up to him and said, \"Maybe we\\'ll \\ndrive to the dacha, it\\'ll be safer there.\" \"No,\" he said, \"it\\'ll be worse \\nthere, you\\'ll be safer at home.\" He said don\\'t be afraid, if something happens \\nI\\'ll send people to save you.\\n\\nAfter he left about 15 minutes passed and about 200 people burst into our \\ncourtyard. All of us were at home at the time: Igor and I and our two \\nchildren, Ira and Edik and their daughter, my sister-in-law Ira, and my \\nmother-and father-in-law. And the Ambartsumian family, there were three of \\nthem, Uncle Misha, Zhasmen, and their daughter Marina. Now when they started\\nbreaking down the door I remember Edik and Igor told us, \"Go in that room\\nand close the door. Close the door and calm the children so they won\\'t hear\\nthat there\\'s anyone home.\" The children started crying. Suddenly Ira, my \\nbrother-in-law\\'s wife, suggested, \"Let\\'s run out onto the balcony.\" We -- the\\ntwo daughters-in-law and the children, and Zhasmen and Marina -- raced out\\nonto the balcony. My sister-in-law and my mother-in-law ran in and said, \\n\"Quick, over to the other balcony, or they\\'ll kill you all.\" We lived on the\\nsecond floor. We needed to cross over from our balcony to our neighbor\\'s. At\\nfirst we couldn\\'t manage it. The balcony looked onto the street. At that time\\npeople were coming home from work, and many just stood there, watching. I \\npleaded and begged: \"Please, call someone, have someone come!\" I even started \\nshouting. \"I\\'ll throw down the children, I\\'ll throw them down, you catch them \\nand take them somewhere, so at least the children will survive.\" Either they \\nwere afraid or . . . I don\\'t know what. They looked as though they were \\nwatching a movie. Some of them started throwing stones at us. I\\'ll say it \\nagain, these weren\\'t the bandits, these were people from the other part of the \\nbuilding and from our entryway, they were just regular people, passersby. A \\nbus even stopped. I remember a man\\'s voice saying the Armenians were climbing\\nover to the other balcony. Ira, my sister-in-law, helped us get the children \\nover there. I was pregnant, about seven months pregnant. No, it wasn\\'t yet \\nseven, it was six and a half. I climbed over too. I think Zhasmen went first; \\nyou know, I just don\\'t remember it all that well. Zhasmen went first, I think, \\nand Edik\\'s wife Ira and I had the children, and they were all screaming and \\ncrying. My Kristina said, \"Mamma, don\\'t throw us over the balcony, we\\'re \\nafraid!\" Lilia was crying, and Kristina and Seryozha were crying too. Kristina \\ndidn\\'t even want to climb over. She shouted, \"I\\'m staying with Grandmother,\\nI\\'m staying with Grandma!\" She loved her grandma, more than she loved me. And \\nmy mother-in-law shouted, \"Oh no, Kristina\\'s still there, she\\'s still there, \\nsave Kristina, too!\" Ira helped us climb over, with Kristina coming last. Ira \\nhelped us and went back inside.\\n\\nWe started pounding on the neighbor\\'s balcony door. I pounded with my fist, \\nSevil, open the door, open it, please!\" She didn\\'t open it. \"No, go away, go \\nanywhere, go, I\\'m not opening the door.\" She was our neighbor, we were \\nfriends, we never refused her anything, ever! And apparently she thought we \\nwere going to break the windows, and she opened the door. She opened it and \\nsaid, \"Karina, Karina, go away, go anywhere, just don\\'t stay here, they\\'ll \\nkill us, too, because of you.\" I begged, \"Please, at least take the children, \\nwe\\'ll leave, we\\'ll go back.\" \"No,\" she said, \"you have to leave.\" Her sons ran \\nin, one had a knife. Sevil\\'s brother, he\\'s around 18, shouted at us: \"Get out \\nof here, leave, I\\'ll kill you with this knife!\" I became terrified, I took the \\nchildren and went out in the entryway and went down a few stairs. I went down \\nand heard a loudspeaker. It was in the courtyard \"The Armenians must be \\nkilled, they\\'ve taken all the best places, all the best apartments!\" One of \\nthem said, \"Let the Armenian blood flow, none of them should survive!\" When I \\nheard that I went upstairs and started knocking on doors. No one opened their \\ndoor for me! Not on the third floor, or the fourth. I couldn\\'t see Zhasmen any \\nlonger. Ira came upstairs later. I even thought that they had let her stay, \\nthat they would save her.\\n\\nMy head was spinning. They were killing my family, and here I was in the next \\nentryway with two children. Seryozha was four, and Kristina was five and a \\nhalf. They were crying, \"Mamma, we\\'re scared!\" They were so frightened that I \\ndidn\\'t even know how to calm them, should I try to calm them or myself? It was \\nawful. But on the third floor a man did open his door. I asked, \"Open up, let \\nme inside!\" He opened the door slightly and said, \"No!\" \"No\" and that was it! \\nHe said it so sternly: \"No!\" I went up to the fifth floor. I pounded my fists \\non the door with all my might. He opened up, the man of the house, and stood \\nthere, looking at me. I was ready to get down on my knees. I almost did get \\ndown on my knees. \"Please, I beg of you, at least take the children.\" He \\nwasn\\'t an Azerbaijani, he was a Lezgin. I don\\'t even know how, but he let me \\ninside. And when I went in, Zhasmen was already there. Two minutes hadn\\'t \\npassed when Ira and Lilia came up the stairs. Lilia was crying. He didn\\'t want \\nto open the door. And again I started pleading, \"Please, open the door, it\\'s \\nour Ira and Lilia! Open the door!\" And he said, \"No, I\\'m afraid.\" I said again \\nand again, \"Please, open the door, please!\" He looked at me. He looked at me \\nfor a long time and then opened the door after all. Ira came in with Lilia. We \\nthrew ourselves into each other\\'s arms, crying. Then the man locked us into \\nthe bathroom. We sat there for a long time. Through the door he told us, \"Calm \\nthe children, and calm yourselves down, too.\"\\n\\nCalm down? This man was hiding us, but what of our family? When I was still in \\nour apartment I had sensed that none of us would come out of this alive. I \\nsaid, \"Igor, Edik, let\\'s say farewell.\" And Edik turned around and looked at \\nme as if to say, is that some kind of joke? All the same I thought they would \\nkill all of us. Igor looked at me, too . . . But it was already too late! They \\nstarted pounding on the door, Igor was standing next to the door. Before that \\nhe had told us, \"Go lock yourselves in that room and sit tight.\" He thought we \\nwere in the room. But before we went out onto the balcony we went to them: \\n\"Edik, Igor, let\\'s say farewell.\" Igor didn\\'t think we could climb over to the \\nother balcony. And we did get over there, and I myself can\\'t believe we were \\nable to save ourselves.\\n\\nIgor put on a helmet, and Edik had his coat on, and he put on a fur hat. All \\nthe men--Igor, Edik, their father, and Misha Ambartsumian--they all stood next \\nto the door. They thought they would pound on it a while and leave. But from \\nthe other side of the door they ordered in Azerbaijani: \"Open the door!\" We \\nwere all silent, waiting. Someone outside the door said, \"They\\'re home,\\nthey\\'re in there, break down the door!\" And I remember my father-in-law \\nwhispering, \"They\\'re going to break it down now, it\\'s coming down now . . . \"\\n\\nHe had something in his hands, I think it was a knife: if they got in, we were \\ngoing to defend ourselves. In the hall near the door there were two metal \\nchair legs. From outside the door they said, \"We\\'re counting to five, open \\nup!\" But we were all quiet, we didn\\'t answer them. We made like no one was \\nhome. We figured they\\'d leave, they\\'d get tired and leave. My father-in-law \\nhad said, \"It\\'s not possible they\\'d come into my home. How can that be? \\nEveryone knows us, all of Sumgait knows our family, we are on good terms with \\neveryone.\" And indeed a day did not pass that there wasn\\'t an Azerbaijani \\nguest at our table. We had a nice dacha, everyone would get together there \\noften, Azerbaijanis liked being with us there too. But now we had to save \\nourselves, we had to flee from our own home. Ira, I remember, said, \"I\\'m not \\nleaving here, my brothers and my parents are here, I\\'m going to fight \\nalongside them.\" That\\'s just what she said. She picked up a knife and said, \\n\"If they open the door and come into the apartment then I\\'m going to fight \\nalongside my family, I\\'m not going anywhere.\"\\n\\nWe were at Sevil\\'s when they broke into our apartment. We heard fighting and \\nshouting. The noise was terrible. And when we hid upstairs on the fifth floor \\nat the Lezgin\\'s apartment, you could hear everything up there, too. Even Ira\\'s \\nvoice. I remember her calling her mother several times. She called her for a \\nlong time . . . I started pounding on the door in the bathroom: \"Open the \\ndoor, what are they doing to Ira, who\\'s shouting, that\\'s Ira shouting, that\\'s \\nher voice!\" But the Lezgin said, \"It\\'s nothing, calm down, no, it\\'s not in \\nyour apartment.\" He was lying to me so I\\'d calm down. Two hours went by and \\nthe Lezgin opened the door and said, \"Karina, Igor got away, calm down. He ran \\naway.\" He saw Igor break away and run off with his own eyes. They killed him \\noutside, next to the building.\\n\\nWhile we were in the bathroom I experienced every possible human terror. The \\nway Ira shouted! She shouted, \"Save me, Mamma, save me! . . . Mamma, Mamma!\" \\nShe repeated it several times. There was a wild din. There were very many \\npeople there, all of them shouting, all of them bellowing, howling, \\nwhistling--you just can\\'t imagine what was going on, what the roar was like.\\n\\nApparently, after they had killed Ira those murderers came into the entryway \\nwhere we were hiding and came upstairs, all the way up to the fifth floor. I \\ndon\\'t know if they were just looking for any Armenians or for us in\\nparticular, but I think they were looking for us because when we had climbed \\nover the balconies someone on the street was saying that the daughters-in-law \\nwere climbing over the balconies. And after we heard Ira we heard them coming \\nup the stairs in the entryway and hammering on the doors. I thought those were \\nour last moments, and started saying good-bye to my children, kissing them. \\nThey were sleeping. I woke them up: \"Kristina! Seryozha, wake up!\" And I tell \\nIra: \"Ira, if something happens, we\\'ll throw ourselves off the balcony.\" We \\nwere on the fifth floor. Apparently our Lezgin neighbor had opened the door \\ntoo, because later he said, \"I opened the door and told them there were no \\nArmenians inside.\" And after they all left our neighbor went out on the \\nbalcony himself to see: they were gone.\\n\\nWe weren\\'t friends with those Lezgin neighbors, we only knew each other from \\nthe building. But the people we were friends with wouldn\\'t even consider \\nhiding us.\\n\\nThe Lezgin let us out of the bathroom. They had a candle burning. He said, \\n\"Karina, there\\'re no lights on in our block.\" The whole block was dark, the \\nwhole block! It\\'s a huge block, too. The Lezgin said, \"I\\'m afraid to keep\\nyou until morning, I\\'m afraid of the neighbors, they might kill me for saving\\nyou.\" I said, \"What are you saying, we\\'ll leave now. But we can\\'t just leave\\nwith the children in the middle of the night. Give us time to find somewhere\\nelse to hide.\" He said, \"Well OK, go look.\" I asked Ira, \"Ira, do you want to\\ngo?\" Ira said, \"No, I\\'ll stay with the children, Karina.\" I said, \"Fine, then\\nI\\'ll go.\" Zhasmen and I went downstairs together. It was very dark. No one \\nwas in the courtyard. It was dark, pitch black. l was afraid to go out at \\nafter seven, Igor always met me after work and accompanied me home, I never \\nwent out alone. And now here I was out in the middle of the night and after a\\nslaughter like that, too. It was probably after eleven. Later I called the \\nboarding school and my director answered. He said, \"Karina, where are you?\" I\\ndidn\\'t know, I was calling from a public phone outside and didn\\'t know where I \\nwas. I got confused and hung up the receiver. From him I only found out what \\ntime it was, I asked him, \"What time is it?\" He said 11:20, I think, but I \\ndon\\'t really remember. So anyway Zhasmen and I went out into the courtyard. I \\nlook and see what appears to be a person not far from our apartment. And there\\nwas the smell of something burnt. I became horrified. I looked at the corpse \\nfor a long time. It was either Ira or Edik. I only saw one of them, Zhasmen \\ngrabbed my hand and squeezed it: \"Hurry up, let\\'s go . . . Hurry up, come on, \\nwhat are you turning around for?\" I turned around and saw a large truck, it \\nmust have belonged to the bandits, because they came to kill us in a truck \\nlike that. We lived in the third entryway, and that truck was next to the \\nfourth. We walked quickly, holding hands. I thought, if I go to the police \\nthen they\\'ll put me away. I couldn\\'t count on them. Before I reached the \\npolice station I saw a military vehicle. We went over and I said, \"Soldier, in \\nBlock 41, I don\\'t know if they\\'ve killed people or injured them--we need to \\nsave them!\" And he said, \"Go to the police station and tell them everything.\" \\nI said, \"I\\'m afraid to go there, I\\'m afraid of them.\" He said, \"Don\\'t be \\nafraid.\"\\n\\nWe went to the police and they wrote down the address, and the military \\nvehicle went to our building. I didn\\'t go with them, they left me at the \\npolice station. I gave the addresses of my mother and my brothers so that \\nthey\\'d rescue them, too. I didn\\'t know where they were or what had happened to\\nthem.\\n\\nAfter a while they brought my children and Ira and Lilia. First they took us \\nto the KGB, that was at two or three in the morning. Then around five they \\ntook us to the City Party Committee, and there were very many people there, \\nvery many. I was pregnant and was wearing nothing but a dress. Seryozha was \\nonly wearing a shirt, and Kristina had a little dress on. No coat, no boots, \\nnothing! And we sat there for three whole days in the City Party Committee.\\n\\nThe Lezgin had told me that Igor escaped. And I thought that he was probably \\nalive. But then after two and a half days, they took us, the Armenians of \\nSumgait, to Nasosny. On March 6 some people from the Central Committee came \\nand told us, \"Karina, Ira, we need you, come with us to the City Party \\nCommittee.\" My Mamma had come to Nasosny, and she had been looking for me for \\nsix days. Mama, my brothers, and my uncle. We went to the City Party Committee \\nand waited there in the courtyard. I was wearing nothing but a dress, and Ira \\nhad only a dress on as well. There was a strong wind on March 6. An hour went \\nby. And then one of the functionaries told us, \"Karina, Ira, gather your \\ncourage. Would you like to go to the burial?\" I said, \"What, did they really \\nkill all of them?!\" He said, \"Let\\'s look.\" He had a long list, and he started \\nreading them off: Igor Melkumian, my husband, Eduard Melkumian, my brother-in-\\nlaw, Irina Melkumian, my sister-in-law, Sogomon Melkumian, my father-in-law,\\nand Raisa Melkumian, my mother-in-law. He read off all their names and said, \\n\"Get in the car, let\\'s go to the burial.\"\\n\\nWe buried our family. I couldn\\'t believe it at the time, I couldn\\'t conceive\\nof it or imagine it . . . And even now I think how shall I explain it to my \\nchildren when they\\'re older?\\n\\nMy children were very attached to their father and their grandfather and\\ngrandmother. Kristina didn\\'t love me the way she loved her grandfather and\\ngrandmother, they spoiled her. Kristina would always announce, \"My grandma is \\nbetter than anyone!\" Now, even though she is getting used to my mother, it\\'s \\ndifficult for her, and once she told her: \"You\\'re a bad grandmother.\"\\n\\nI don\\'t know why, I asked her, \"Kristina, where\\'s Papa?\" and she said, \"They \\nkilled him.\" She knows, she understands it all. And recently I scolded\\nSeryozha severely for something, and he started shouting at me, \"When Papa \\ncomes I\\'m going to tell him everything!\"\\n\\nJuly 26, 1988\\nNairi Boarding House\\nNear the Village of Arzakan\\nHrazdan District\\nArmenian SSR\\n\\t\\t\\t- - - reference - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

From all I've\\nheard from my U.S. relatives, drivers esp. here in Germany are much more agg-\\nressive, but not disciplined. One of my relatives, a L.A. resident, hired a car\\nat the Nuernberg airport and went about 18 miles to our home. He said then that\\nhe grew about 1 year older during this ride and swore he'd never drive a car in\\nGermany again (this was in 1982 and he kept his promise - the situation now is\\neven worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic).\\nWhat you mean by `better disciplined' should perhaps be considered `cautious due\\nto fear': \\nWhen driving around here, you always *have* to take into consideration that the\\nmajority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you: They expect that nobody\\nfails or sleeps; many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can\\ngo (of course only where that is allowed, you might think - dream on :).\\nSo any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health - and if you're ex-\\nposed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver, you learn to\\nhandle it - or you lose... \\nThat's the way I and most people I know experience our traffic situation - \\nwhether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you; I think we handle\\na very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest (compared to\\nthe volume) and decreasing rates of lethal accidents - OTOH, more and more\\npeople (esp. women) dislike driving (because they feel overtaxed and threatened)\\nand each accident is one accident too much.\\n\\n\\nBetter designed and maintained, may be - but animal fences are very rare. Auto-\\nbahnen and many other streets have guard-rails (I hope that's the right word - \\na plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights; it's about 2 feet high);\\nthose guard-rails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road. Smaller animals\\ncan crawl under the plank, bigger ones can easily jump over it. The point is\\nthat esp. larger animals are very rare in Germany; they tend also to be very\\ntimid. Accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger.\\n\\n\\nYou're right (there are speed linits even on the major part of the Autobahn) -\\nbut the attitude towards driving (see above) seems to be very similar to that\\nin Germany (I've been in France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Spain, Belgium,\\nthe Netherlands) - besides that, you really can't rely on the residents abiding\\nthe local speed limits. I've got quite a lot of practise (~120k miles) and I'm\\nused to travel at 130 mph (FYI, with a car even smaller than a rabbit), but I\\nconsider driving on the highways round Paris or Milano really a thrill...\\n\\n\\nSorry, but you'll find quite a lot rabbit-class-car (or even smaller, mine is a\\nPeugeot 205) owners going that fast; small cars with much HP are very `hip' over\\nhere - and most people buying such cars aren't afraid to let them run.\\n\\n\\nI disagree; the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant. Formula-1 cars\\nweigh less than 700 kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at\\n130 mph or higher - OTOH when crashing against a solid object at 130 mph,\\nit makes no difference whether you sit in a Porsche, a Mercedes, a tank or on\\na bicycle: Your're dead.\\n\\nBye,\\nStefan\\n---\\nStefan Dalibor (dalibor@immd3.uni-erlangen.de)\",\n",

Over against them stand the \\nsettlers and rightwing parties, who also interpret the \\ndecision to encourage the establishment of a Palestinian \\npolice force as a significant step towards the instituting of \\nreal autonomy, something which will restrict what can be \\ndone by the Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza \\nStrip. With a variety of demonstrations, including street \\ntheater on \\'What will happen when there is a Palestinian \\npolice force\\', rightwing elements are attempting to \\nfrighten the Israeli public and to pressure Rabin to go \\nback on his decision. Members of the Kach movement \\nhave even begun to organize a \\'settler police force\\' in the \\nOccupied Territories, as counter-balance to the future \\nPalestinian police force.\\n\\nHowever, as Barzilai points out, the main function of the \\nnew police force - as far as the Israeli government is \\nconcerned - has nothing to do with the settlers, over \\nwhom they will apparently have no authority, but will \\ncontrol political groups within the Palestinian population, \\nwhom the government is interested in neutralizing. \\nWrites Barzilai:\\n\\n\"...According to ideas currently taking shape, the setting \\nup of a local police force in the territories will precede, \\nnot only the stage of electsion, but also the final stages of \\nthe preparing of the interim autonomy agreement.\\n\\n\"The willingness of the Israeli government to set up a \\nlocal Palestinian police force is evidence that the \\ngovernment is serious about arriving at a settlement with \\nthe Palestinians...\"\\n\\nIt\\'s no wonder that the Palestinian public is also greatly \\nworried about this new Israeli initiative. And it is \\ninevitable that pressure will be brought to bear on Faisal \\nHusseini and the rest of the delegation members, from a \\nvariety of directions, to refuse the gift which Rabin would \\nlike to give them. But at this stage, it looks like the \\nPalestinians are cooperating in the fulfillment of his \\nplans.\\n',\n",

In fact, JPL is actively\\ninvolved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three\\nimportant ways,\" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on\\nthe balloon research campaign.  \\n\\n     \"There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,\" he\\ncontinued.  \"The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists,\\nand the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth\\nfor those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own\\nright.\"\\n\\n     The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more\\npieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the\\nmid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring. \\nUnderstanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps\\nscientists construct more accurate computer models which are\\ninstrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.\\n\\n     The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL\\ninstruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures\\nozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere;\\na submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave\\nradiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier\\ntransform infrared interferometer which monitors how the\\natmosphere absorbs sunlight. \\n\\n     Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three-\\nhour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130\\nkilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground\\nstations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m.\\nPacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded\\nto separate from the balloon.\\n\\n     \"We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared\\nmeasurements,\" Margitan explained, \"and we also needed to fly in\\ndarkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.\"\\n\\n     It will be several weeks before scientists will have the\\ncompleted results of their experiments.  They will then forward\\ntheir data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space\\nFlight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS\\nscientists.    \\n\\n     The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon\\nFacility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a\\ncontract from NASA\\'s Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was\\nlaunched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction\\nand the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.\\n\\n     The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than\\none-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic\\nmeters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with\\nhelium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh\\nbetween 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The\\nscientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds\\nand is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.\\n\\n     The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA\\'s Upper\\nAtmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements\\nProgram.

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\\nGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners\\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).\\nI narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling\\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less\\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\\nI was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent\\'s office on the way.  I asked\\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as\\nthe Celica (the \\'85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that\\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue\\nto handle your account.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we\\'ll have to change you to the standard\\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\\na 944, it\\'s another story again - we\\'ll cover the rest of this year,\\nbut cancel you after that.\"\\n \\n\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens\\'t make sense.\"\\n \\n That\\'s what the book says.  We don\\'t insure Corvettes, either.  For\\nsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -\\nas very traditional and conservative.\"\\n \\nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche\\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken\\na year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I\\nconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto\\ntheft.\\n \\n   /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\\\| |\\\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone\\'s entitled to MY opinion.\\n  / | |/ ||\\\\|\\\\  \\\\_|\\\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil\\n========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n======================================================================== 32\\n \\nI live in Idaho.

First you discuss your non-existent literature\\ntastes, then your fantasies, and now your choices of historical revisionism.\\nAre you related to \\'Arromdians\\' of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and\\nRevisionism Triangle?\\n\\nThe Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term \\'Turks,\\' \\nwhich demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference \\nto \\'Muslims.\\' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the \\nexistence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the \\nessential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger \\nTurkish minority. The \\'Pomaks\\' are also a Muslim people, whom all the \\nthree nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of \\nthemselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized \\naccording to the agreements? \\n\\nIt also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece \\nand the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world.\\nThe Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish\\nminority. They pursue the same denial in connection with \\nthe Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition,\\nin 1980 the \\'democratic\\' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091,\\nvirtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and\\nother charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting\\nreligious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek \\ngovernments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective\\nof the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although\\nthe Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in\\nGreece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing\\nits religious leaders. Talk about democracy.\\n\\nThe government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic \\nconvention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an \\nattitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a \\nviolation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the \\'so-called\\' \\nGreek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection \\nof historical monuments. \\n\\nThe government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new \\nchurches in remote villages as a complementary step toward \\nHellenizing the region.\\n\\nThe longstanding use of the adjective \\'Turkish\\' in titles\\nand on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts have\\nordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers\\' Association, \\nthe Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti \\nTurkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks\\nin Western Thrace. Such community associations had been \\nactive until 1984. But they were first told to remove\\nthe word \\'Turkish\\' on their buildings and on their official\\npapers and then eventually close down. This is also the \\nfinal verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court.\\n\\nHelsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating \\nthe plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their \\nfindings were published in a report titled \\n\\n \\'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.\\'\\n\\nThe report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the \\nTurkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance, \\nthe Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in \\nKomotini.

The  allegations  regarding  territorial  aspirations\\nagainst  Greece are  tales... We  are in  a panic  to secure  the\\nborder, at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EEC\\nare falling.\"\\n\\n  The  main  charge  against  the two,  according  to  the  court\\nsummons,  was   that  \"they  have   spread...intentionally  false\\ninformation  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  the\\ncitizens,  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  the\\ninternational interests of the country (Greece).\"\\n\\n  The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  a\\nMacedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350,000 to\\n1,000,000  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece,  largely\\nconcentrated in the north. It is  a crime against the Greek state\\nif anyone declares themselves Macedonian.\\n\\n  In  1913  Greece,   Serbia-Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partioned\\nMacedonia into three  pieces. In 1919 Albania  took 50 Macedonian\\nvillages. The part under  Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in\\n1991  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia.  There are  1.5\\nmillion Macedonians in the Republic; 500,000 in Bulgaria; 150,000\\nin Albania; and 300,000 in Serbia proper.\\n\\n  Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonian\\nhuman rights in  Greece, and lost his job as  a forestry worker a\\nfew years ago.  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island in\\nthe mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forced\\nthe Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town of\\nFlorina (Lerin) in Northern  Greece (Aegean Macedonia), where the\\nmajority of ethnic Macedonians live.\\n\\n  Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial in\\nwhich  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent,\\nespecially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for its\\nnorthern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia.\\n\\n  Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemned\\nGreece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (who\\nlargely live in Western Thrace).

Gain values\\n\\t    of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are\\n\\t    always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, \"high-thrust\"\\n\\t    interplanetary flight is not possible, because system\\n\\t    acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local\\n\\t    gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100\\n\\t    times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer\\n\\t    \"high-thrust\" flight capability. One performance example shows a\\n\\t    53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with\\n\\t    19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle.

Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion\\n\\tEnergy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.\\n\\n\\t    Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron\\n\\t    flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times\\n\\t    larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma\\n\\t    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds\\n\\t    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities\\n\\t    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and\\n\\t    other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm\\n\\t    innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure\\n\\t    efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically\\n\\t    compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power\\n\\t    conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens\\n\\t    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the\\n\\t    multi-gigawatt electric output size.

In the\\nbiology context, we would very likely read \"fitness\" for \"the score of\\nthe game\" and \"organisms\" for \"teams\".  How we interpret \"players\" is\\ntrickier, but either \"organs\", or \"genes\" might seem reasonable\\nchoices depending on what point we were trying to make.  A \"genes\"\\ninterpretation actually might be really interesting in this case, \\nbut that would be a different and probably longer post.\\n\\nIf, however, we take the \"organ\" view, then our knowledge of biology\\nshould make us pause before we start saying things like \"species X is\\nmore fit than species Y because of a better organ Z\".  Given what we\\nknow about the interdependence of organs, we would often be suspicious\\nof such claims.  (But note that this type of argument is quite often\\nmade when you map \"species X\" onto \\'humans\\', and \"organ Z\" onto\\n\\'brain\\').  On the other hand, some statements of this kind do seem\\nmore reasonable than others, as far as we can test them (e.g. \\'brain\\'\\nabove might be more reasonable than \\'pancreas\\' assuming no gross\\npathology, particularly if species Y is a primate).\\n\\nEven when you make such statements, you should be concerned with the\\nfunctioning of the whole organism, and the possibility that one organ\\nmight be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another.\\n(Not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucial\\nin some third species.)  However, if we are non-vitalists with any\\nkind of reductionsit streak, we will want to say that an organism is\\nnot some completely magical unanalyzable \"whole\" but an intriguing\\nprocess made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that are\\npotentially observable.  Some of these processes might be localized to\\nparticular organs, while others may be distributed across multiple\\norgans.  In a way, this is just like a baseball team, except that I\\nthink it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involved\\nin baseball are *much* simpler and less numerous than in most organisms.\\n\\n\\nOne thing that is quite difficult about baseball is that perfectly\\ncontrolled experiments are sometimes very tough to do.  But, of\\ncourse, this has never stopped researchers from doing the best they\\ncan, and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in the\\nabsence of certainty.  Most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation,\\nbut even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research.\\n\\n\\nIn this cases, we\\'re seeing the word \"statistics\" means \"summary of\\nobserved events\", where the events themselves can be viewed as the\\noutput of some process, and possibly inputs for other processes.\\nThus, if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put together\\ninto the functioning organism, data in the form of statistics might\\ngive us a basis to test particular hypotheses.\\n\\n\\nThis statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again.\\nFitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment;\\nyou might be fit in one situation and not another.  Moving to\\nbaseball, it is clear that each team spends the entire season in an\\nenvironment including all the other teams in the league.  In at least\\na nominal sense, the division winners are the fittest teams in the\\nleague, in that they (on average) had better fitness scores than any\\nof their competing opponennts.  But in a real sense, there is a fairly\\nlarge random component in the performance of each team that is\\ndifficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factors\\nintrinsic to (or interesting for) baseball.  The same is true in\\nbiology.  But here is also no direct biological equivalent of the\\nWorld Series in basebal.  In the world series, the random component\\nmay be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played,\\nand both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environement\\nwhere they were originally successful.  It might be fun to watch, but\\nit\\'s unclear what it all really means.\\n\\n***\\n\\nNow just one more un-related point:\\n\\n\\nOn the other hand, you have seen some of us who can predict the\\noutcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment of\\nteams to finishes, and maybe some of us (e.g. me) who can do this\\nbetter than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis.\\nBut this is probably only due to the fact that a 162-game schedule\\ngives you a little hope that bad hops aren\\'t the only difference\\nbetween the winners and the losers.\\n\\nMoreover, you\\'ve had the opportunity to see some analysis of the World\\nSeries situation that makes the strong claim that *nobody* can predict\\nthe WS winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased only\\nto reflect the well-known home vs. road effect on winning percentage.\\n\\n\\nSince stats are summaries of events, it\\'s true that if you know the\\nevents you can derive the stats.  But if somebody is trying to\\nunderstand the process behind the stats, then the stats produce new\\nknowledge, and some of this might even be reliable, repeatable, and\\nuseful.  Speaking of which, I should get back to producing knowledge\\nin a different field.  That is, of course, if I can produce knowledge\\neven though I\\'m relying on stats to do it.',\n",

       " '\\nMy apologies if this is a re-post - I submitted it on Friday, but \\ngot a message that my post might not have gone out.  Considering \\nthe confusing spitting contest over \\'rights\\', (there are TOO \\ninalienable rights damn it!  The majority can be just as destructive \\nof liberty as a despot), I suspect that my post did not get out \\nof my site.    (I ain\\'t saying that dark skies are included in these \\nrights, although we can only preserve any rights by exercising them.) \\n\\n\\n\\nAnyway, here are my thoughts on this: \\n\\n\\nI\\'d like to add that some of the \"protests\" do not come from a strictly \\npractical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for \\nresearch activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I \\nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may \\nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \\nunsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars \\nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \\na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \\n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \\nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \\nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \\nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \\nin an afterlife.  \\n\\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \\nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \\ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \\nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \\nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \\nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \\nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \\n\\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \\nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \\ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \\nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \\nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \\ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \\nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \\n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \\none weekend, \"getting away from it all\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \\nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \\nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \\nmiles to the east.  (Their \\'security light\\' didn\\'t help matters \\nmuch either.)  But I\\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \\nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \\n\\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\\'t \\nfouled in some way.  (I mean they\\'ve been TRYING this forever - \\nlike, concerning Tesla\\'s idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don\\'t watch \\ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \\ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \\nIf ya\\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \\nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \\n\\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \\nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \\n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \\nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I\\'ll be trying to see it \\nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could \\nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \\nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that \\nas it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, \\neven if it can\\'t ever be perfectly achieved. \\n\\nRegards, \\nWm. Hathaway \\nBaltimore MD \\n',\n",

But you\\'ve picked the wrong topic if you think a few\\nrigged \"quotations\" can sustain the legend and lie of the Deir\\nYassin \"massacre.\"\\n\\nYou have a lot to learn when it comes to historical methodology.\\nAt the most basic level, you should know that there is a big\\ndifference between weighing evidence fairly and merely finding\\n\"quotations\" that support your preset opinions.\\n\\nIf you have studied the history of Israel at all you must know that\\nmany of the sources of your \"quotations\" have an axe to grind, and\\ntherefore you must be very careful about whom you \"quote.\"  For\\nexample, Meir Pa\\'il, whom you cite, was indeed a general, a scholar,\\nand a war hero.  But that doesn\\'t mean everything that comes out of\\nhis mouth is gold.  In fact (and here your lack of experience\\nshows), Pa\\'il is such a fanatic, embittered leftist that much of his\\nanti-Israel blathering (forget about anti-Irgun blathering) would be\\nconsidered something like treason in non-Israel contexts.  But of\\ncourse you don\\'t consider this AT ALL when you find a juicy\\n\"quotation\" that you can use to attack Israel.\\n\\nBenny Morris (of Hashomer Hatzair) represents himself as a \"scholar\"\\nwhen he rehashes the old attacks on the Irgun.  Don\\'t be fooled.\\nIt\\'s just the old Zionist ideological catfight, surfacing as an\\nattack on the (then-) Likud government.  If you will look closely at\\nthe section on Deir Yassin in his book on the War of Independence,\\nyou will see his \"indictment\" to be pure hot air.  And this is the\\nBEST HE CAN DO after decades of digging for any sort of damning\\nevidence.  Unfortunately for him, because his book parades itself as\\n\"scholarly,\" he is forced to put footnotes.  So you can clearly see\\nthat his Deir Yassin account is based on nothing.\\n\\nThe Deir Yassin \"massacre\" never took place as the propagandists\\ntell it, any more than the Sabra and Shatila \"massacres.\" Do you get\\nthe feeling people like to blame the Jews for \"massacres,\" even if\\nthey have to make them up?

Diplomats and aid\\nworkers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.\\n\\nThe 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of\\nthe last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control\\nof Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations\\nin Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting\\nretreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the\\ndead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first\\nsuppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.\\nLater  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken\\nAzerbaijan\\'s wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000\\ndead.\\n\\nThe State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a\\n15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \"Hojali\\nDisaster\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on\\npreliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman\\nMemmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in\\nthe Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more\\nthan 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700\\ndead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman\\nof the Azeri Ministry of Defence.\\n\\nFranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International\\nRed Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of\\nAgdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque\\nfrom  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \"We  did  not count  the\\nbodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\" Mr\\nZen Ruffinen said. \"We have some idea since we gave the body bags\\nand products to wash the dead.\"\\n\\nMr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the\\nnumber of  dead in the  massacre. \"Don\\'t  get worked up.  It will\\ntake  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\" the  43-year-old\\nlawyer said at his small office.\\n\\nMr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to\\nreach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714\\nwounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist\\nuprising in Baku in January 1990.\\n\\nThose  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power\\nthree weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly\\nwhat  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70\\nmiles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.\\n\\nOfficially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being\\nthe  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the\\nrepublic\\'s forensic department. \"This  is just a small percentage\\nof the dead,\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic\\'s chief forensic\\nscientist. \"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the\\nchaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury\\nour dead within 24 hours.\"\\n\\nOf these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14\\nyears old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and\\naxes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland\\nsnows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of\\ndeliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises\\ncut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov\\'s\\nreport. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those\\nbelieved to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.\\n\\nFiles  from  Mr  Rasulov\\'s  investigative  commission  are  still\\ndisorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six\\npolicemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the\\nnames of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day.

       " '\\nThis a \"tried and true\" method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups:\\nto conduct operations in the midst of the local populace, thus forcing the\\nopposing \"state\" to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or,\\nin order to avoid the deaths of civilians, abandon the search. Certainly the\\npeople who use the population for cover are *also* to blaim for dragging the\\ninnocent civilians into harm\\'s way.\\n\\nAre you suggesting that, when guerillas use the population for cover, Israel\\nshould totally back down? So...the easiest way to get away with attacking\\nanother is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects\\ninnocent lives?\\n\\n\\nYour damn right Israel insists on some sort of \"demilitarized\" or \"buffer\"\\nzone. Its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territory\\nof Arab states and watched as the states did nothing. It is not exactly\\nsurprizing that Israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to \\ndo it themselves.\\n\\n\\nWhat? So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states \\ncan start all over again? While I also hope for this to happen, it will\\nonly occur WHEN Arab states show that they are *prepared* to take on the \\nresponsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their \\nsoil. They have to Prove it (or provide some \"guaratees\"), there is no way\\nIsrael is going to accept their \"word\"- not with their past attitude of \\ntolerance towards \"anti-Israel guerillas in-residence\".\\n\\nGood lord, Brad. What in the world goves you the idea that UN troops stop\\nanything? They are ONLY stationed in a country because that country allows\\nthem in. It can ask them to leave *at any time*; as Nasser did in \\'56 and\\n\\'67. Somehow, with that \"limitation\" on the troops \"powers\" I don\\'t\\nthink that Israel is going to be any more comfortable. Without a *genuine* commitment to peace from the Arab states, and concrete (not intellectual or political exercises in jargon) \"guarantees\" by other parties, the UN is worthless\\nto Israel (but, perhaps useful as a \"ruse\"?).\\n\\n\\nPerhaps you are aware that, to most communities of people, there is\\nthe feeling that it is better that \"many of us die fighting\\nagainst those who attack us than for few to die while we silently \\naccept our fate.\" If,however, you call on Israel to see the sense of \\nsuffering fewer casualties, I suggest you apply the same to Palestinian,\\nArab and Islamic groups.\\n\\n\\nFrom Israel\\'s perspective, \"concessions\" gets it NOTHING...except the \\nrealization that it has given \"something\" up and now *can only \\nhope* that the other side decides to do likewise. Words *can be taken\\nback* by merely doing so; to \"take back\" tangible items (land,\\ncontrol of land) requires the sort of action you say Israel should\\nstay away from.\\n \\nIsrael put up with attacks from Arab state territories for decades \\nbefore essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of Lebanon.\\nThe entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above: 1) Israel \\nwould express outrage at these attacks and protest to the Arab state \\ninvolved, 2) that state promptly ignored the entire matter, secure \\nin the knowledge that IT could not be held responsible for the acts \\ncommitted by \"private groups\", 3) Israel would prepare for the next \\nround of attacks. What would Israel want to return to those days (and\\ndon\\'t be so idiotic as to suggest \"trust\" for the motivations of\\npresent-day Arab states)?\\n\\nAh, ok...what is \"different\" about the present situation that tells\\nus that the Arab states will *not* pursue their past antagonistic \\npolicies towards Israel? Now, don\\'t talk about vague \"political factors\"\\nbut about those \"tangible\" (just like that which Israel gave up)\\nfactors that \"guarantee\" the responsibility of those states. Your\\nassessment of \"difference\" here is based on a whole lot of assumptions,\\nand most states don\\'t feel confortable basing their existence on that\\nsort of thing.\\n\\n\\nIt has not. Without the support, and active involvement, of Syria,\\nLebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred.\\nOnce Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain \\ncontrol? If Syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for Israel.\\nTim',\n",

An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of\\n      directions and clues guiding participates around the \\n      Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course\\n      based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will\\n      be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which\\n      they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the\\n      number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately \\n      lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is \\n      set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points\\n      will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions\\n      or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,\\n      basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.\\n\\n   2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants\\n      will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.\\n      Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles\\n      without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half\\n      the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle\\n      unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will\\n      divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified\\n      4x4s can run the course.\\n     \\n  At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring\\n  participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.\\n  Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.\\n\\n* This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles\\n  so safety and fun is our foremost concern.

Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though \\n I heard our Utica brass roar.\\n\\n As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear.

But these shots and\\n the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women\\'s cries.\\n\\n At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward\\n Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and \\n tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly,\\n through alders, on smoldering houses.

In exile,\\nthey practiced a terrorist approach to liberating Croatia; while Croats in\\nCroatia followed the approach of peaceful negotiations under the leadership\\nof Vladko Macek.  After the Axis powers took control in the SECOND world\\nwar, Vladko Macek refused to collaborate, so Ustashas were brought in \\nto run the newly formed puppet state.  This state included both Croatia and\\nBosnia-Herzegovina, and its ideology saw Muslims as the best Croats\\n(\"flowers of Croatian people\").  Some Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina\\ntherefore joined Ustashas.  However, even more others did not; they\\njoined Tito\\'s Partisans.    The Ustashas membership peaked at \\nless than 1% of Croat and Muslim population of that area at that time.\\n\\nAfter WWII, Muslims were still considered a religious minority descended\\nfrom Croats or Serbs who converted to Islam centuries ago.  But, in 1968,\\nit was decided that forcing Muslims to declare their nationality as\\neither Serbs or Croats is not a good policy.  Dobrica Cosic, the current\\npresident of the rump Yugoslavia, was strongly opposed, and sought to\\nprevent the category \"Muslim\" (in an ethnic sense) from appearing on the\\nnext census.  He was criticized and expelled from the party.

Paradoxically, barely one-third\\n of Transcaucasia\\'s Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the \\n Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan\\n uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians\\n as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,\\n however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the\\n guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000\\n inhabitants. This impressive change in the province\\'s ethnic character \\n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \\n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \\n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\" \\n (See also Map 1.

The main legal principles of the Turkish State \\nare summarized in Article 2 of the Constitution:\\n\\n\\t\"The Republic of Turkey is a democratic, secular and social State\\n\\tgoverned by the rule of law; bearing in mind the concepts of public\\n\\tpeace, national solidarity and justice; respecting human rights;\\n\\tloyal to the nationalism of Ataturk, and based on the fundamental\\n\\ttenets set forth in the Preamble of the Constitution.\"\\n\\nFreedom of culture and religion prevailed during the Ottoman Empire, allowing\\nthe many nations and races within its boundaries to remain autonomous. The\\nfact that the Ottoman Empire was the longest lived in recent history may be\\nattributed to these freedoms, despite the lack of any written Constitution.\\nThe first attempts to create a written Constitution occurred in 1839 and 1856.\\nAlthough the documents adopted during these two attempts remained in force\\nonly temporarily, they provided the basic elements of a Constitution.\\n\\nThe 1876 Constitution was the first legal document to force a Parliament and\\nthe right of election to share the sovereignty of the Emperor. The Constitution\\nof 1906 placed some additional limitations on the Emperor, while increasing\\nthe power of the Parliament and the government.\\n\\nThe First World War (1914-1918) brought the Ottoman Empire to an end. By the\\noccupation of Istanbul, the Parliament was dissolved and the Constitution was\\nabolished. The members of Parliament were sent to exile to an island by the\\noccupying forces.\\n\\nDuring the Independence War, the \"Turkish Grand National Assembly\" held their\\nfirst meeting on April 23, 1920 to serve as the legislative body of the new\\nTurkish state. This assembly prepared the new legal structure of the Turkish\\nRepublic. The new Republic was proclaimed on October 29, 1923 and the new\\nConstitution was adopted in 1924. That Constitution served as the legal \\nbackbone of today\\'s modern Turkish Republic. In 1945, Turkey adopted a \\nmulti-party political system. The Constitution of 1924 was replaced by\\nothers in 1961 and 1982. All three Constitutions of the Republic have been\\nbased on the principles of parliamentary democracy, human rights, national\\nsovereignty, division of powers, private ownership and secularization.\\n\\n\"Major Principles of the Constitution\"\\n\\nThe constitution (with 177 Articles) establishes the structure of the Republic\\nwithin the following principles:\\n\\n- The Turkish Republic is a democratic, secular and social state governed by \\n  law;\\n- It should be governed to maintain public peace, national solidarity, justice,\\n  human rights and the objectives of Ataturk;\\n- The language of the State is Turkish;\\n- Sovereignty is vested in the nation without any conditions or restrictions.\\n  Sovereignty is exercised by organizations authorized by the nation;\\n- Legislative power is carried by the Parliament elected by the nation. This\\n  power cannot be delegated (transferred) to any one else;\\n- Executive power is exercised by the President, and Council of Ministers;\\n- Judicial power is exercised by the independent courts on behalf of the\\n  Turkish nation;\\n- All individuals are equal, irrespective of language, race, religion, color,\\n  sex, or political beliefs;\\n- Laws cannot be contradict those principles stated in the Constitution.\\n\\n\"Structure of the State\"\\n\\nIn accordance with the Constitution, the structure of the state is based on the\\nprinciple of \"division of power\" to create a balanced and self-controlled\\nsystem. The power is divided into \"legislative power,\" \"executive power,\" and\\n\"judicial power,\" balanced to secure freedoms and powers to control each\\nother (self-control).\\n\\n A. Legislative Power:\\n\\n The \"Turkish Grand National Assembly\" is a parliament with one House, elected\\n by the nation for a term of five years to exercise legislative power on\\n behalf of the nation. The basic functions of this Assembly are:\\n\\n - to adopt, to amend, or to repeal laws;\\n - to approve or to dismiss the Council of Ministers;\\n - to supervise and to question Ministers or the Council of Ministers;\\n - to debate, to amend and to approve annual budgets;\\n - to ratify international agreements;\\n - to grant amnesty or pardons.\\n\\n Members of Parliament do not have any liability for their words (either oral\\n or written) during the course of their legislative duties. The country is\\n divided into constituencies. The number of representatives of each is\\n calculated according to its population. Every Turkish citizen over the age\\n of twenty-one can vote.\\n\\n Elections are supervised by the \"Supreme Council of Elections,\" which solves\\n all disputes or appeals. In each province, the local \"Board of Election\"\\n runs and controls the election under the supervision and guidelines of the\\n Supreme Council. Members of the Council and Boards are elected among \\n independent judges.\\n\\n B. Executive Power:\\n\\n The President of the Republic is the Head of State (not the head of government\\n as in the Unites States). The main functions of the President are:\\n\\n - to represent the State and the Country;\\n - to insure the implementation of the Constitution;\\n - to coordinate legislative, judicial and executive functions;\\n - act as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces;\\n - to ratify laws and government decrees.\\n \\n The President is elected by the Grand National Assembly for a period of seven\\n years. The President may ratify or return the laws for a second debate, may \\n call for a referendum.\\n\\n Executive power is exercised by the \"Council of Ministers,\" headed by the\\n Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President from the\\n members of Parliament. The Prime Minister names the Ministers for approval\\n by the President. The new Government (Council of Ministers) reads their\\n program at the Parliament and the vote of confidence follows. There are 21 (?)\\n Ministers in the Council.\\n\\n Ministers and other members of the administration can be sued in independent\\n \"administrative\" courts for their misuse of power, administrative errors or\\n functions against any law.\\n\\n C. Judicial Power:\\n\\n Judicial power is exercised by independent courts. No authority or power can\\n instruct the judges or public prosecutors of the courts. These cannot be \\n discharged, replaced or retired by executive authorities except for the\\n reasons clearly stated by the appropriate laws. There are three categories\\n of courts in the Turkish judiciary system:\\n\\n - Courts of justice deal with legal, commercial and criminal cases. The \\n   decisions of these courts may be reviewed by the supreme court of justice\\n   upon the appeal of the parties involved.\\n - The decisions or functions of the executive power (including the Prime\\n   Minister and Ministers or any governmental department) can be appealed in\\n   administrative courts if these functions or decisions are against the law.\\n   The decisions of these administrative courts may also be reviewed by the\\n   high administrative court.\\n\\n The laws and decisions of the Grand National Assembly can be examined by the\\n \"Constitutional Court\" if they contradict the Constitution. If found\\n contradictory, this court may cancel the decisions or laws of the Parliament.\\n\\n\\nSerdar Argic',\n",

Since my note taking ability is by no means\\ninfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is \\ngranted to copy this without restriction.\\n\\nMichael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an\\ninformal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois.\\nACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and\\nInternational Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the\\ncompany is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that\\nhis daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.\\n\\nThe concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga\\nto visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king,\\nwho happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which \\nthe king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million,\\nHis Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought\\nthere probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous\\nsatellite slots.  While this isn\\'t entirely off the wall, it was very unusual,\\nseeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of\\nslots.\\n\\nThe whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl\\nHilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions\\nsupporting Tonga\\'s case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from \\n70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside).\\nAccording to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the\\nworld because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and \\nthe Pacific Rim. \\n\\nRIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax\\nhaven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to\\nfill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have\\ncost approximately $2 billion.  It\\'s not easy to raise that kind of money.\\nEventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began \\nnegotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in \\nMoscow in such harsh terms that I don\\'t think I\\'ll visit there for a long time.\\nBesides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way\\nthat people operate.  For example \"everybody can sell you everything.\"  \\nEveryone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the\\nonly ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.\\n\\nEventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost\\nof $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg\\nsays that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who \\nwent to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was\\nout of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He\\nagain described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually,\\nhe worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the \\nRussian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions\\nbefore signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to \\nallow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.\\n\\nThe next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied \\nMechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in \\nSiberia (can\\'t figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built\\nabout 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that\\nsiberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest\\npeople who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this\\npoint there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on\\nboth siberians and midwesterners :-)\\n\\nSternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is \\napparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that\\nwould sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them \\nspecifications, they\\'ll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites\\nthat RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This\\ncompares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1\\nmillion compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their \\nsatellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They \\nhave the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give\\nyou their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are\\ngetting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place\\nnow.\\n\\nTidbits:\\n\\n*  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big\\nbusiness because big business is just like what they have over there, except\\nthat \"we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.\"\\n\\n*  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch\\nwithin 9 months.\\n\\n*  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement\\nfund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia,\\nand a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is\\nsort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.\\n\\n*  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried\\npartly because we aren\\'t used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying\\nmonolith.  Italy gets a new government \"every two weeks\" but we don\\'t worry \\nbecause we\\'re used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what\\nreally goes on in Russia we won\\'t worry about their stability as much.\\n\\n*  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering\\nmoney.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting\\n25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the \"equivalent\" value in \\nrubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian\\nbank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that\\nthe only the contractors get swindled by the government.\\n\\n*  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western \\nsatellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type\\nof satellites, which was rather reassuring.\\n\\n*  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive\\ntechnology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have\\na lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare\\nwell with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much \\nshorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the \\ndifference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition,\\nshorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer\\ntechnology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date\\nhardware.\\n',\n",

It is **very** difficult to \"identify\" who they are (this\\n*is why* the \"guerillas\" prefer to lose themselves in the general population \\nby dressing the same, acting the same, etc.).\\nI agree; but, because Lebanon was either unwilling or unable to stop these\\nattacks from its territory should Israel simply sit quietly and accept its\\nsituation? Israel asked the Lebanese government over and over to control\\nthis \"third party state\" within Lebanese territory and the attacks kept\\noccuring. At **what point** does Israel (or ANY state) have the right to do\\nsomething ITSELF to stop such attacks? Never?\\nIt is also the responsibility of *any* state to NOT ALLOW *any* outside\\nparty to use its territory for attacks on a neighboring state. If 1) Angola\\nhad the power, and 2) South Africa refused (or couldn\\'t) stop anti-Angolan\\nguerillas based on SA soil from attacking Angola, and 3) South Africa\\nrefused to have UN troops stationed on its territory between it and Angola,\\nwould Angola be justified in entering SA? If not, are you saying that\\nAngola HAD to accept the situation, do NOTHING and absorb the attacks?\\nI refered above *at all times* to the Palestinian attacks on Israel from\\nLebanese soil, NOT to Lebanese attacks on Israel. \\n\\nOne hopes that a Lebanese government will be strong enough to patrol its \\nborder but there is NO reason to believe it will be any stronger. WHAT HAS \\nCHANGED is that the PLO was largely *driven out* of Lebanon (not by the \\nLebanese, not by Syria) and THAT is by far the most important making it \\nEASIER to control future Palestinian attacks from Lebanese soil. That\\n**change** was brought about by Israeli action; the PLO would *never*\\nhave been ejected by Lebanese, Arab state or UN actions. \\nI fully recognize that the Lebanese do NOT WANT to be \"used\" by EITHER side,\\nand have been (and continue to be).

       " 'I will try to answer some of Dorin\\'s questions, even though they were\\nnot addressed to me specifically, but I feel that I am a bit concerned\\nby the thread since I am a Southern Lebanese from a village that is \\noften on the receiving end of Israel\\'s bombs.\\nIn the first place the death of three soldiers on a patrol in occupied\\nLebanese terrritory is NOT an act of terrorism or murder.  It is \\ndisingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich\\nor any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed \\nsolely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.\\nIt seems to me, Dorin, that, you are so remote and ignorant of the problem\\non the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant,\\nand heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation.\\nI will try to paint the most accurate picture I can of\\nwhat the situation really is in South Lebanon.\\n\\n\\n\\nI am.  I was back in my home village this last summer.  For your information\\nwe are PEOPLE, not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists.  Most of the \\npeople in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily\\nbusiness, some work in the fields, some own small shops, others are\\nolder men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee.  Is that so hard to\\nimagine ????  It is NOT a \"terrorist camp\" as you and the Israelis like \\nto view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer\\nin the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....\\nSOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of\\nthe Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not \\nknow who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often\\nsuspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are\\nsupported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and\\nammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps\\nfor Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured\\nby these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages\\nof their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they\\nare back they announce that they bombed a \"terrorist  hideout\" where\\nan 8 year old girl just happened to be.\\nWe are now accustomed to Israeli tactics, and we figure that this is \\nthe Israeli way of telling us that \"if you\\'re gonna hurt our soldiers\\nyou\\'re gonna pay the price\".  We accept this as a price we have to pay\\nto free our land, Israel knows very well that it is not really hurting\\nthe resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but rather\\njust keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young \\nmen to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks are\\ntaking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers.\\nIsrael\\'s retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that\\nwe have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance\\non the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING \\nISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real \\nleverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.\\nThe people of South Lebanon are occupied, or shelled by Israel on a \\nregular basis.  We do not want to be occupied.  If Israel insists that\\nthe so called \"Security Zone\" is necessary for the protection of \\nNorthern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupation\\nwith the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace,\\nthan it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the \\nestablishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protect\\nour villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel, so the\\nbest policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and the\\nestablishment of peace keeping troops along the border.\\n\\nI have written before on this very newsgroup, that the only\\nreal solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace\\nsettlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and\\npeace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure\\nno one on either side of the border is shelled.\\nThis is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to\\nrealize that the concept of a \"buffer zone\" aimed at protecting\\nits northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more\\nIsraeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel\\nwould have resulted in.  \\nIf Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw \\nunilaterally from the so-called \"Security Zone\" before the conclusion\\nof the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives,\\nadvance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel\\'s \\npublic image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations \\nsince Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in \\npeace and has already offered some important concessions.\\nAlong with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah\\nbe disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not \\naccept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a\\nshelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone\\nand will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it.\\nThere seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese\\ngoovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such \\ncircumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is\\ncapable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did\\nin all other parts of Lebanon.\\n  \\n\\nI agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing\\nCANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.\\n\\n I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make\\n\\nYes, we have no quarrel with Jews, or Israeli civilians.\\nThe real problem is with OCCUPYING Israeli soldiers and those brave\\nIsraeli pilots that bomb our civilian villages every time an \\noccupying soldier is attacked.\\n \\n',\n",

The advantages are obvious: the bus would have carried out the\\nsame basic Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus-Neptune mission than Voyager 2 did, but in\\naddition two \"sub-probes\" could have been relased at Saturn, examining\\nthat planet\\'s south polar regions before moving on to Pluto. This would have\\nenabled NASA to map both hemispheres of Pluto/Charon by 1986...and several\\nother probes could have examined parts of the Jupiter/Saturn/Uranus/Neptune\\nsystems that weren\\'t examined in great detail by the Voyagers due to\\ntrajectory-related factors.

But the most\\nimportant problem of those units has been hardly dealt with. It is\\nthat everyone who serves in the Cherry, after a time goes in one\\nway or another insane\".\\n\\nA man who said this, who will here be called Danny (his full name\\nis known to the editors) served in the Cherry. After his discharge\\nfrom the army he works as delivery boy. His pal, who will here be\\ncalled Dudu was also serving in the Cherry, and is now about to\\ndepart for a round-the-world tour. They both look no different\\nfrom average Israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript\\nservice. But in their souls, one can notice something completely\\ndifferent....It was not easy for them to come out with disclosures\\nabout what happened to them. And they think that to most of their\\nfellows from the Cherry it woundn\\'t be easy either. Yet after they\\nbegan to talk, it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking.\\nThe following article will contain all the horror stories\\nrecounted with an appalling openness.\\n\\n(...) A short time ago I was in command of a veteran team, in\\nwhich some of the fellows applied for release from the Cherry. We\\ncalled such soldiers H.I. \\'Hit by the Intifada\\'. Under my command\\nwas a soldier who talked to himself non-stop, which is a common\\nphenomenon in the Cherry. I sent him to a psychiatrist. But why I\\nshould talk about others when I myself feel quite insane ? On\\nFridays, when I come home, my parents know I cannot be talked to\\nuntil I go to the beach, surf a little, calm down and return. The\\nkeys of my father\\'s car must be ready for in advance, so that I\\ncan go there. I they dare talk to me before, or whenever I don\\'t\\nwant them to talk to me, I just grab a chair and smash it\\ninstantly. I know it is my nerve:  Smashing chairs all the time\\nand then running away from home, to the car and to the beach. Only\\nthere I become normal.(...)\\n\\n(...) Another friday I was eating a lunch prepared by my mother.\\nIt was an omelette of sorts. She took the risk of sitting next to\\nme and talking to me. I then told my mother about an event which\\nwas still fresh in my mind. I told her how I shot an Arab, and how\\nexactly his wound looked like when I went to inspect it. She began\\nto laugh hysterically. I wanted her to cry, and she dared laugh\\nstraight in my face instead ! So I told her how my pal had made a\\nmincemeat of the two Arabs who were preparing the Molotov\\ncocktails. He shot them down, hitting them beautifully, exactly as\\nthey deserved. One bullet had set a Molotov cocktail on fire, with\\nthe effect that the Arab was burning all over, just beautifully. I\\nwas delighted to see it.  My pal fired three bullets, two at the\\nArab with the Molotov cocktail, and the third at his chum. It hit\\nhim straight in his ass. We both felt that we\\'d pulled off\\nsomething.\\n\\nNext I told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts\\nin the belly of another Arab and how all of us ran toward that\\nspot to take a look. I reached the spot first. And then that Arab,\\nblood gushing forth from his body, spits at me. I yelled: \\'Shut\\nup\\' and he dared talk back to me in Hebrew! So I just laughed\\nstraight in his face. I am usually laughing when I stare at\\nsomething convulsing right before my eyes. Then I told him: \\'All\\nright, wait a moment\\'. I left him in order to take a look at\\nanother wounded Arab. I asked a soldier if that Arab could be\\nsaved, if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the\\nhelp of a stone of something else like that. I keep telling all\\nthis to my mother, with details, and she keeps laughing straight\\ninto my face. This infuriated me. I got very angry, because I felt\\nI was becoming mad. So I stopped eating, seized the plate with he\\nomelette and some trimmings still on, and at once threw it over\\nher head. Only then she stopped laughing. At first she didn\\'t know\\nwhat to say.\\n\\n(...) But I must tell you of a still other madness which falls\\nupon us frequently. I went with a friend to practice shooting on a\\nfield. A gull appeared right in the middle of the field. My friend\\nshot it at once. Then we noticed four deer standing high up on the\\nhill above us. My friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it.\\nWe enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock. We shot down two\\ndeer more and went to take a look. When we climbed the rocks we\\nsaw a young deer, badly wounded by our bullet, but still trying to\\nsuch some milk from its already dead mother. We carefully\\ninspected two paths, covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of\\nthe two deer we had hit. We were just delighted by that sight. We\\nhad hit\\'em so good ! Then we decided to kill the young deer too,\\nso as spare it further suffering. I approached, took out my\\nrevolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short\\ndistance. When you shoot straight at the head you actually see the\\nbullets sinking in.  But my fifth bullet made its brains fall\\noutside onto the ground, with the effect of splattering lots of\\nblood straight on us. This made us feel cured of the spurt of our\\nmadness. Standing there soaked with blood, we felt we were like\\nbeasts of prey. We couldn\\'t explain what had happened to us. We\\nwere almost in tears while walking down from that hill, and we\\nfelt the whole day very badly.\\n\\n(...) We always go back to places we carried out assignments in.\\nThis is why we can see them. When you see a guy you disabled, may\\nbe for the rest of his life, you feel you got power. You feel\\nGodlike of sorts.\"\\n\\n(...) Both Danny and Dudu contemplate at least at this moment\\nstudying the acting. Dudu is not willing to work in any\\nsecurity-linked occupation. Danny feels the exact opposite. \\'Why\\nshouldn\\'t I take advantage of the skills I have mastered so well ?\\nWhy shouldn\\'t I earn $3.000 for each chopped head I would deliver\\nwhile being a mercenary in South Africa ?

In 1975, the\\nManta, 1900 sedan (also called the Ascona) and the wagon were available with\\nBosch electronic fuel injection.  These cars also had larger brakes and\\nwider wheels.

Ancient astronomers observed points of\\nlight that appeared to move among the stars. They called these\\nobjects planets, meaning wanderers, and named them after Roman\\ndeities -- Jupiter, king of the gods; Mars, the god of war;\\nMercury, messenger of the gods; Venus, the god of love and\\nbeauty, and Saturn, father of Jupiter and god of agriculture. The\\nstargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails, and meteors\\nor shooting stars apparently falling from the sky.\\n\\n     Science flourished during the European Renaissance.\\nFundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were\\ndiscovered, and the orbits of the planets around the Sun were\\ncalculated. In the 17th century, astronomers pointed a new device\\ncalled the telescope at the heavens and made startling\\ndiscoveries.\\n\\n     But the years since 1959 have amounted to a golden age of\\nsolar system exploration. Advancements in rocketry after World\\nWar II enabled our machines to break the grip of Earth\\'s gravity\\nand travel to the Moon and to other planets.\\n\\n     The United States has sent automated spacecraft, then\\nhuman-crewed expeditions, to explore the Moon. Our automated\\nmachines have orbited and landed on Venus and Mars; explored the\\nSun\\'s environment; observed comets, and made close-range surveys\\nwhile flying past Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.\\n\\n     These travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and\\nunderstanding of the solar system. Through the electronic sight\\nand other \"senses\" of our automated spacecraft, color and\\ncomplexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appeared\\nto Earth-bound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light.\\nAnd dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered.\\n\\n     Future historians will likely view these pioneering flights\\nthrough the solar system as some of the most remarkable\\nachievements of the 20th century.\\n     \\n\\nAUTOMATED SPACECRAFT\\n\\n     The National Aeronautics and Space Administration\\'s (NASA\\'s)\\nautomated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many\\nshapes and sizes. While they are designed to fulfill separate and\\nspecific mission objectives, the craft share much in common.\\n\\n     Each spacecraft consists of various scientific instruments\\nselected for a particular mission, supported by basic subsystems\\nfor electrical power, trajectory and orientation control, as well\\nas for processing data and communicating with Earth.\\n\\n     Electrical power is required to operate the spacecraft\\ninstruments and systems. NASA uses both solar energy from arrays\\nof photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power its\\nsolar system missions. Rechargeable batteries are employed for\\nbackup and supplemental power.\\n\\n     Imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyed\\nmillions of miles through space to fly but one time near a\\nplanet, only to have its cameras and other sensing instruments\\npointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target! To help\\nprevent such a mishap, a subsystem of small thrusters is used to\\ncontrol spacecraft.\\n\\n     The thrusters are linked with devices that maintain a\\nconstant gaze at selected stars. Just as Earth\\'s early seafarers\\nused the stars to navigate the oceans, spacecraft use stars to\\nmaintain their bearings in space. With the subsystem locked onto\\nfixed points of reference, flight controllers can keep a\\nspacecraft\\'s scientific instruments pointed at the target body\\nand the craft\\'s communications antennas pointed toward Earth. The\\nthrusters can also be used to fine-tune the flight path and speed\\nof the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered at\\nthe planned distance and on the proper trajectory.\\n\\n     Between 1959 and 1971, NASA spacecraft were dispatched to\\nstudy the Moon and the solar environment; they also scanned the\\ninner planets other than Earth -- Mercury, Venus and Mars. These\\nthree worlds, and our own, are known as the terrestrial planets\\nbecause they share a solid-rock composition.\\n\\n     For the early planetary reconnaissance missions, NASA\\nemployed a highly successful series of spacecraft called the\\nMariners. Their flights helped shape the planning of later\\nmissions. Between 1962 and 1975, seven Mariner missions conducted\\nthe first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space.\\n\\n     All of the Mariners used solar panels as their primary power\\nsource. The first and the final versions of the spacecraft had\\ntwo wings covered with photovoltaic cells. Other Mariners were\\nequipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonal\\nbodies.\\n\\n     Although the Mariners ranged from the Mariner 2 Venus\\nspacecraft, weighing in at 203 kilograms (447 pounds), to the\\nMariner 9 Mars Orbiter, weighing in at 974 kilograms (2,147\\npounds), their basic design remained quite similar throughout the\\nprogram. The Mariner 5 Venus spacecraft, for example, had\\noriginally been a backup for the Mariner 4 Mars flyby. The\\nMariner 10 spacecraft sent to Venus and Mercury used components\\nleft over from the Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter program.\\n\\n     In 1972, NASA launched Pioneer 10, a Jupiter spacecraft.\\nInterest was shifting to four of the outer planets -- Jupiter,\\nSaturn, Uranus and Neptune -- giant balls of dense gas quite\\ndifferent from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed.\\n\\n     Four NASA spacecraft in all -- two Pioneers and two Voyagers\\n-- were sent in the 1970s to tour the outer regions of our solar\\nsystem. Because of the distances involved, these travelers took\\nanywhere from 20 months to 12 years to reach their destinations.\\nBarring faster spacecraft, they will eventually become the first\\nhuman artifacts to journey to distant stars. Because the Sun\\'s\\nlight becomes so faint in the outer solar system, these travelers\\ndo not use solar power but instead operate on electricity\\ngenerated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes.\\n\\n     NASA also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit\\nour neighbors Mars and Venus in the middle and late 1970s. Twin\\nViking Landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weather\\nstations and as biology laboratories. Two advanced orbiters --\\ndescendants of the Mariner craft -- carried the Viking Landers\\nfrom Earth and then studied martian features from above.\\n\\n     Two drum-shaped Pioneer spacecraft visited Venus in 1978.\\nThe Pioneer Venus Orbiter was equipped with a radar instrument\\nthat allowed it to \"see\" through the planet\\'s dense cloud cover\\nto study surface features. The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe carried\\nfour probes that were dropped through the clouds. The probes and\\nthe main body -- all of which contained scientific instruments --\\nradioed information about the planet\\'s atmosphere during their\\ndescent toward the surface.\\n\\n     A new generation of automated spacecraft -- including\\nMagellan, Galileo, Ulysses, Mars Observer, the Comet\\nRendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini -- is being\\ndeveloped and sent out into the solar system to make detailed\\nexaminations that will increase our understanding of our\\nneighborhood and our own planet.\\n     \\n\\nThe Sun\\n\\n     A discussion of the objects in the solar system must start\\nwith the Sun. The Sun dwarfs the other bodies, representing\\napproximately 99.86 percent of all the mass in the solar system;\\nall of the planets, moons, asteroids, comets, dust and gas add up\\nto only about 0.14 percent. This 0.14 percent represents the\\nmaterial left over from the Sun\\'s formation. One hundred and nine\\nEarths would be required to fit across the Sun\\'s disk, and its\\ninterior could hold over 1.3 million Earths.\\n\\n     As a star, the Sun generates energy through the process of\\nfusion. The temperature at the Sun\\'s core is 15 million degrees\\nCelsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit), and the pressure there\\nis 340 billion times Earth\\'s air pressure at sea level. The Sun\\'s\\nsurface temperature of 5,500 degrees Celsius (10,000 degrees\\nFahrenheit) seems almost chilly compared to its core-temperature.\\nAt the solar core, hydrogen can fuse into helium, producing\\nenergy. The Sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streams\\nof charged particles, both extending far beyond the planets.\\n\\n     The Sun appears to have been active for 4.6 billion years\\nand has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years or\\nso. At the end of its life, the Sun will start to fuse helium\\ninto heavier elements and begin to swell up, ultimately growing\\nso large that it will swallow Earth. After a billion years as a\\n\"red giant,\" it will suddenly collapse into a \"white dwarf\" --\\nthe final end product of a star like ours. It may take a trillion\\nyears to cool off completely.\\n\\n     Many spacecraft have explored the Sun\\'s environment, but\\nnone have gotten any closer to its surface than approximately\\ntwo-thirds of the distance from Earth to the Sun. Pioneers 5-11,\\nthe Pioneer Venus Orbiter, Voyagers 1 and 2 and other spacecraft\\nhave all sampled the solar environment. The Ulysses spacecraft,\\nlaunched on October 6, 1990, is a joint solar mission of NASA and\\nthe European Space Agency. After using Jupiter\\'s gravity to\\nchange its trajectory, Ulysses will fly over the Sun\\'s polar\\nregions during 1994 and 1995 and will perform a wide range of\\nstudies using nine onboard scientific instruments.\\n\\n     We are fortunate that the Sun is exactly the way it is. If\\nit were different in almost any way, life would almost certainly\\nnever have developed on Earth.\\n     \\n\\nMercury\\n\\n     Obtaining the first close-up views of Mercury was the\\nprimary objective of the Mariner 10 spacecraft, launched on\\nNovember 3, 1973, from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After a\\njourney of nearly five months, which included a flyby of Venus,\\nthe spacecraft passed within 703 kilometers (437 miles) of the\\nsolar system\\'s innermost planet on March 29, 1974.\\n\\n     Until Mariner 10, little was known about Mercury. Even the\\nbest telescopic views from Earth showed Mercury as an indistinct\\nobject lacking any surface detail. The planet is so close to the\\nSun that it is usually lost in solar glare. When the planet is\\nvisible on Earth\\'s horizon just after sunset or before dawn, it\\nis obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere. Only radar\\ntelescopes gave any hint of Mercury\\'s surface conditions prior to\\nthe voyage of Mariner 10.\\n\\n     The photographs Mariner 10 radioed back to Earth revealed an\\nancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling our own\\nMoon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing the\\nplanet. These apparently were created when Mercury\\'s interior\\ncooled and shrank, buckling the planet\\'s crust. The cliffs are as\\nhigh as 3 kilometers (2 miles) and as long as 500 kilometers (310\\nmiles).\\n\\n     Instruments on Mariner 10 discovered that Mercury has a weak\\nmagnetic field and a trace of atmosphere -- a trillionth the\\ndensity of Earth\\'s atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon, neon\\nand helium. When the planet\\'s orbit takes it closest to the Sun,\\nsurface temperatures range from 467 degrees Celsius (872 degrees\\nFahrenheit) on Mercury\\'s sunlit side to -183 degrees Celsius\\n(-298 degrees Fahrenheit) on the dark side. This range in surface\\ntemperature -- 650 degrees Celsius (1,170 degrees Fahrenheit) --\\nis the largest for a single body in the solar system. Mercury\\nliterally bakes and freezes at the same time.\\n\\n     Days and nights are long on Mercury. The combination of a\\nslow rotation relative to the stars (59 Earth days) and a rapid\\nrevolution around the Sun (88 Earth days) means that one Mercury\\nsolar day takes 176 Earth days or two Mercury years -- the time\\nit takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around the\\nSun! \\n\\n     Mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock like\\nthat of Earth. Scientists believe Mercury has a heavy iron-rich\\ncore making up slightly less than half of its volume. That would\\nmake Mercury\\'s core larger, proportionally, than the Moon\\'s core\\nor those of any of the planets.\\n\\n     After the initial Mercury encounter, Mariner 10 made two\\nadditional flybys -- on September 21, 1974, and March 16, 1975 --\\nbefore control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhausted\\nand the mission was concluded. Each flyby took place at the same\\nlocal Mercury time when the identical half of the planet was\\nilluminated; as a result, we still have not seen one-half of the\\nplanet\\'s surface.\\n     \\n\\nVenus\\n\\n     Veiled by dense cloud cover, Venus -- our nearest planetary\\nneighbor -- was the first planet to be explored. The Mariner 2\\nspacecraft, launched on August 27, 1962, was the first of more\\nthan a dozen successful American and Soviet missions to study the\\nmysterious planet. As spacecraft flew by or orbited Venus,\\nplunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on Venus\\' surface,\\nromantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid to\\nrest.\\n\\n     On December 14, 1962, Mariner 2 passed within 34,839\\nkilometers (21,648 miles) of Venus and became the first\\nspacecraft to scan another planet; onboard instruments measured\\nVenus for 42 minutes. Mariner 5, launched in June 1967, flew much\\ncloser to the planet. Passing within 4,094 kilometers (2,544\\nmiles) of Venus on the second American flyby, Mariner 5\\'s\\ninstruments measured the planet\\'s magnetic field, ionosphere,\\nradiation belts and temperatures. On its way to Mercury, Mariner\\n10 flew by Venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to Earth\\nshowing cloud circulation patterns in the Venusian atmosphere.\\n\\n     In the spring and summer of 1978, two spacecraft were\\nlaunched to further unravel the mysteries of Venus. On December 4\\nof the same year, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter became the first\\nspacecraft placed in orbit around the planet.\\n\\n     Five days later, the five separate components making up the\\nsecond spacecraft -- the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe -- entered the\\nVenusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet. The\\nfour small, independent probes and the main body radioed\\natmospheric data back to Earth during their descent toward the\\nsurface. Although designed to examine the atmosphere, one of the\\nprobes survived its impact with the surface and continued to\\ntransmit data for another hour.\\n\\n     Venus resembles Earth in size, physical composition and\\ndensity more closely than any other known planet. However,\\nspacecraft have discovered significant differences as well. For\\nexample, Venus\\' rotation (west to east) is retrograde (backward)\\ncompared to the east-to-west spin of Earth and most of the other\\nplanets.\\n\\n     Approximately 96.5 percent of Venus\\' atmosphere (95 times as\\ndense as Earth\\'s) is carbon dioxide. The principal constituent of\\nEarth\\'s atmosphere is nitrogen. Venus\\' atmosphere acts like a\\ngreenhouse, permitting solar radiation to reach the surface but\\ntrapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back into\\nspace. As a result, the planet\\'s average surface temperature is\\n482 degrees Celsius (900 degrees Fahrenheit), hot enough to melt\\nlead.\\n\\n     A radio altimeter on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter provided the\\nfirst means of seeing through the planet\\'s dense cloud cover and\\ndetermining surface features over almost the entire planet.\\nNASA\\'s Magellan spacecraft, launched on May 5, 1989, has been in\\norbit around Venus since August 10, 1990. The spacecraft uses\\nradar-mapping techniques to provide ultrahigh-resolution images\\nof the surface.\\n\\n     Magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanic\\nfeatures, faults and impact craters. Huge areas of the surface\\nshow evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flows\\nlying on top of previous ones. An elevated region named Ishtar\\nTerra is a lava-filled basin as large as the United States. At\\none end of this plateau sits Maxwell Montes, a mountain the size\\nof Mount Everest. Scarring the mountain\\'s flank is a\\n100-kilometer (62-mile) wide, 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) deep\\nimpact crater named Cleopatra. (Almost all features on Venus are\\nnamed for women; Maxwell Montes, Alpha Regio and Beta Regio are\\nthe exceptions.) Craters survive on Venus for perhaps 400 million\\nyears because there is no water and very little wind erosion.\\n\\n     Extensive fault-line networks cover the planet, probably the\\nresult of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonics\\non Earth. But on Venus the surface temperature is sufficient to\\nweaken the rock, which cracks just about everywhere, preventing\\nthe formation of major plates and large earthquake faults like\\nthe San Andreas Fault in California.\\n\\n     Venus\\' predominant weather pattern is a high-altitude,\\nhigh-speed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid. At\\nspeeds reaching as high as 360 kilometers (225 miles) per hour,\\nthe clouds circle the planet in only four Earth days. The\\ncirculation is in the same direction -- west to east -- as Venus\\'\\nslow rotation of 243 Earth days, whereas Earth\\'s winds blow in\\nboth directions -- west to east and east to west -- in six\\nalternating bands. Venus\\' atmosphere serves as a simplified\\nlaboratory for the study of our weather.\\n     \\n\\nEarth\\n\\n     As viewed from space, our world\\'s distinguishing\\ncharacteristics are its blue waters, brown and green land masses\\nand white clouds. We are enveloped by an ocean of air consisting\\nof 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other\\nconstituents. The only planet in the solar system known to harbor\\nlife, Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of 150 million\\nkilometers (93 million miles). Earth is the third planet from the\\nSun and the fifth largest in the solar system, with a diameter\\njust a few hundred kilometers larger than that of Venus.\\n\\n     Our planet\\'s rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give\\nrise to an extensive magnetic field, which, along with the\\natmosphere, shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation\\ncoming from the Sun and other stars. Earth\\'s atmosphere protects\\nus from meteors as well, most of which burn up before they can\\nstrike the surface. Active geological processes have left no\\nevidence of the pelting Earth almost certainly received soon\\nafter it formed -- about 4.6 billion years ago. Along with the\\nother newly formed planets, it was showered by space debris in\\nthe early days of the solar system.\\n\\n     From our journeys into space, we have learned much about our\\nhome planet. The first American satellite -- Explorer 1 -- was\\nlaunched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on January 31, 1958, and\\ndiscovered an intense radiation zone, now called the Van Allen\\nradiation belts, surrounding Earth.\\n\\n     Since then, other research satellites have revealed that our\\nplanet\\'s magnetic field is distorted into a tear-drop shape by\\nthe solar wind -- the stream of charged particles continuously\\nejected from the Sun. We\\'ve learned that the magnetic field does\\nnot fade off into space but has definite boundaries. And we now\\nknow that our wispy upper atmosphere, once believed calm and\\nuneventful, seethes with activity -- swelling by day and\\ncontracting by night. Affected by changes in solar activity, the\\nupper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on Earth.\\n\\n     Besides affecting Earth\\'s weather, solar activity gives rise\\nto a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere. When charged\\nparticles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth\\'s magnetic\\nfield, they collide with air molecules above our planet\\'s\\nmagnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and are\\nknown as the auroras or the northern and southern lights.\\n\\n     Satellites about 35,789 kilometers (22,238 miles) out in\\nspace play a major role in daily local weather forecasting. These\\nwatchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms. Continuous\\nglobal monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data and\\ncontributes to a better understanding of Earth\\'s complex weather\\nsystems.\\n\\n     From their unique vantage points, satellites can survey\\nEarth\\'s oceans, land use and resources, and monitor the planet\\'s\\nhealth. These eyes in space have saved countless lives, provided\\ntremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering our\\nplanet in dangerous ways.\\n     \\n\\nThe Moon\\n\\n     The Moon is Earth\\'s single natural satellite. The first\\nhuman footsteps on an alien world were made by American\\nastronauts on the dusty surface of our airless, lifeless\\ncompanion. In preparation for the human-crewed Apollo\\nexpeditions, NASA dispatched the automated Ranger, Surveyor and\\nLunar Orbiter spacecraft to study the Moon between 1964 and 1968.\\n\\n     NASA\\'s Apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materials\\nand data. Six two-astronaut crews landed on and explored the\\nlunar surface between 1969 and 1972, carrying back a collection\\nof rocks and soil weighing a total of 382 kilograms (842 pounds)\\nand consisting of more than 2,000 separate samples.\\n\\n     From this material and other studies, scientists have\\nconstructed a history of the Moon that includes its infancy.\\nRocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about 4.0-4.3\\nbillion years old. The first few million years of the Moon\\'s\\nexistence were so violent that few traces of this period remain.\\nAs a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified into\\ndifferent kinds of rock, the Moon was bombarded by huge asteroids\\nand smaller objects. Some of the asteroids were as large as Rhode\\nIsland or Delaware, and their collisions with the Moon created\\nbasins hundreds of kilometers across.\\n\\n     This catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately four\\nbillion years ago, leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge,\\noverlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and broken\\nrock. Heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began to\\nmelt the interior of the Moon at depths of about 200 kilometers\\n(125 miles) below the surface. Then, for the next 700 million\\nyears -- from about 3.8 to 3.1 billion years ago -- lava rose\\nfrom inside the Moon. The lava gradually spread out over the\\nsurface, flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areas\\nthat Galileo Galilei, an astronomer of the Italian Renaissance,\\ncalled maria, meaning seas.\\n\\n     As far as we can tell, there has been no significant\\nvolcanic activity on the Moon for more than three billion years.\\nSince then, the lunar surface has been altered only by\\nmicrometeorites, by the atomic particles from the Sun and stars,\\nby the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft and\\nastronauts. If our astronauts had landed on the Moon a billion\\nyears ago, they would have seen a landscape very similar to the\\none today. Thousands of years from now, the footsteps left by the\\nApollo crews will remain sharp and clear.\\n\\n     The origin of the Moon is still a mystery. Four theories\\nattempt an explanation: the Moon formed near Earth as a separate\\nbody; it was torn from Earth; it formed somewhere else and was\\ncaptured by our planet\\'s gravity, or it was the result of a\\ncollision between Earth and an asteroid about the size of Mars.\\nThe last theory has some good support but is far from certain.\\n     \\n\\nMars\\n\\n     Of all the planets, Mars has long been considered the solar\\nsystem\\'s prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life.\\nAstronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw what\\nappeared to be straight lines crisscrossing its surface. These\\nobservations -- later determined to be optical illusions -- led\\nto the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed a\\nsystem of irrigation canals on the planet. In 1938, when Orson\\nWelles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fiction\\nclassic War of the Worlds  by H.G. Wells, enough people believed\\nin the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic.\\n\\n     Another reason for scientists to expect life on Mars had to\\ndo with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planet\\'s\\nsurface. This phenomenon led to speculation that conditions might\\nsupport a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer months\\nand cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods.\\n\\n     So far, six American missions to Mars have been carried out.\\nFour Mariner spacecraft -- three flying by the planet and one\\nplaced into martian orbit -- surveyed the planet extensively\\nbefore the Viking Orbiters and Landers arrived.\\n\\n     Mariner 4, launched in late 1964, flew past Mars on July 14,\\n1965, coming within 9,846 kilometers (6,118 miles) of the\\nsurface. Transmitting to Earth 22 close-up pictures of the\\nplanet, the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurring\\nchannels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water.\\nMariners 6 and 7 followed with their flybys during the summer of\\n1969 and returned 201 pictures. Mariners 4, 6 and 7 showed a\\ndiversity of surface conditions as well as a thin, cold, dry\\natmosphere of carbon dioxide.\\n\\n     On May 30, 1971, the Mariner 9 Orbiter was launched on a\\nmission to make a year-long study of the martian surface. The\\nspacecraft arrived five and a half months after lift-off, only to\\nfind Mars in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm that made\\nsurface photography impossible for several weeks. But after the\\nstorm cleared, Mariner 9 began returning the first of 7,329\\npictures; these revealed previously unknown martian features,\\nincluding evidence that large amounts of water once flowed across\\nthe surface, etching river valleys and flood plains.\\n\\n     In August and September 1975, the Viking 1 and 2 spacecraft\\n-- each consisting of an orbiter and a lander -- lifted off from\\nKennedy Space Center. The mission was designed to answer several\\nquestions about the red planet, including, Is there life there?\\nNobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities, but it was\\nhoped that the biology experiments on the Viking Landers would at\\nleast find evidence of primitive life -- past or present.\\n\\n     Viking Lander 1 became the first spacecraft to successfully\\ntouch down on another planet when it landed on July 20, 1976,\\nwhile the United States was celebrating its Bicentennial. Photos\\nsent back from the Chryse Planitia (\"Plains of Gold\") showed a\\nbleak, rusty-red landscape. Panoramic images returned by the\\nlander revealed a rolling plain, littered with rocks and marked\\nby rippled sand dunes. Fine red dust from the martian soil gives\\nthe sky a salmon hue. When Viking Lander 2 touched down on Utopia\\nPlanitia on September 3, 1976, it viewed a more rolling landscape\\nthan the one seen by its predecessor -- one without visible\\ndunes.\\n\\n     The results sent back by the laboratory on each Viking\\nLander were inconclusive. Small samples of the red martian soil\\nwere tested in three different experiments designed to detect\\nbiological processes. While some of the test results seemed to\\nindicate biological activity, later analysis confirmed that this\\nactivity was inorganic in nature and related to the planet\\'s soil\\nchemistry. Is there life on Mars? No one knows for sure, but the\\nViking mission found no evidence that organic molecules exist\\nthere.\\n\\n     The Viking Landers became weather stations, recording wind\\nvelocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature and\\npressure. Few weather changes were observed. The highest\\ntemperature recorded by either craft was -14 degrees Celsius (7\\ndegrees Fahrenheit) at the Viking Lander 1 site in midsummer.\\n\\n     The lowest temperature, -120 degrees Celsius (-184 degrees\\nFahrenheit), was recorded at the more northerly Viking Lander 2\\nsite during winter. Near-hurricane wind speeds were measured at\\nthe two martian weather stations during global dust storms, but\\nbecause the atmosphere is so thin, wind force is minimal. Viking\\nLander 2 photographed light patches of frost -- probably\\nwater-ice -- during its second winter on the planet.\\n\\n     The martian atmosphere, like that of Venus, is primarily\\ncarbon dioxide. Nitrogen and oxygen are present only in small\\npercentages. Martian air contains only about 1/1,000 as much\\nwater as our air, but even this small amount can condense out,\\nforming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around\\nthe slopes of towering volcanoes. Local patches of early morning\\nfog can form in valleys.\\n\\n     There is evidence that in the past a denser martian\\natmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet. Physical\\nfeatures closely resembling shorelines, gorges, riverbeds and\\nislands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet.\\n\\n     Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. They are small and\\nirregularly shaped and possess ancient, cratered surfaces. It is\\npossible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured too\\nclose to Mars and were captured by its gravity.\\n\\n     The Viking Orbiters and Landers exceeded by large margins\\ntheir design lifetimes of 120 and 90 days, respectively. The\\nfirst to fail was Viking Orbiter 2, which stopped operating on\\nJuly 24, 1978, when a leak depleted its attitude-control gas.\\nViking Lander 2 operated until April 12, 1980, when it was shut\\ndown because of battery degeneration. Viking Orbiter 1 quit on\\nAugust 7, 1980, when the last of its attitude-control gas was\\nused up. Viking Lander 1 ceased functioning on November 13, 1983.\\n\\n     Despite the inconclusive results of the Viking biology\\nexperiments, we know more about Mars than any other planet except\\nEarth. NASA\\'s Mars Observer spacecraft, to be launched in\\nSeptember 1992, will expand our knowledge of the martian\\nenvironment and lead to human exploration of the red planet. \\n     \\n\\nAsteroids\\n\\n     The solar system has a large number of rocky and metallic\\nobjects that are in orbit around the Sun but are too small to be\\nconsidered full-fledged planets. These objects are known as\\nasteroids or minor planets. Most, but not all, are found in a\\nband or belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Some have\\norbits that cross Earth\\'s path, and there is evidence that Earth\\nhas been hit by asteroids in the past. One of the least eroded,\\nbest preserved examples is the Barringer Meteor Crater near\\nWinslow, Arizona.\\n\\n     Asteroids are material left over from the formation of the\\nsolar system. One theory suggests that they are the remains of a\\nplanet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago. More\\nlikely, asteroids are material that never coalesced into a\\nplanet. In fact, if the estimated total mass of all asteroids was\\ngathered into a single object, the object would be only about\\n1,500 kilometers (932 miles) across -- less than half the\\ndiameter of our Moon. \\n\\n     Thousands of asteroids have been identified from Earth. It\\nis estimated that 100,000 are bright enough to eventually be\\nphotographed through Earth-based telescopes.\\n\\n     Much of our understanding about asteroids comes from\\nexamining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface of\\nEarth. Asteroids that are on a collision course with Earth are\\ncalled meteoroids. When a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere at\\nhigh velocity, friction causes this chunk of space matter to\\nincinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor. If the\\nmeteoroid does not burn up completely, what\\'s left strikes\\nEarth\\'s surface and is called a meteorite. One of the best places\\nto look for meteorites is the ice cap of Antarctica.\\n\\n     Of all the meteorites examined, 92.8 percent are composed of\\nsilicate (stone), and 5.7 percent are composed of iron and\\nnickel; the rest are a mixture of the three materials. Stony\\nmeteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very much\\nlike terrestrial rocks.\\n\\n     Since asteroids are material from the very early solar\\nsystem, scientists are interested in their composition.\\nSpacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found\\nthat the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids are\\nseparated by very large distances.\\n\\n     Current and future missions will fly by selected asteroids\\nfor closer examination. The Galileo Orbiter, launched by NASA in\\nOctober 1989, will investigate main-belt asteroids on its way to\\nJupiter. The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini\\nmissions will also study these far-flung objects. Scheduled for\\nlaunch in the latter part of the 1990s, the CRAF and Cassini\\nmissions are a collaborative project of NASA, the European Space\\nAgency and the federal space agencies of Germany and Italy, as\\nwell as the United States Air Force and the Department of Energy.\\nOne day, space factories will mine the asteroids for raw\\nmaterials.\\n     \\n\\nJupiter\\n\\n     Beyond Mars and the asteroid belt, in the outer regions of\\nour solar system, lie the giant planets of Jupiter, Saturn,\\nUranus and Neptune. In 1972, NASA dispatched the first of four\\nspacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of these\\ncolossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock. Jupiter\\nwas the first port of call.\\n\\n     Pioneer 10, which lifted off from Kennedy Space Center in\\nMarch 1972, was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid\\nbelt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system. In\\nDecember 1973, it returned the first close-up images of Jupiter,\\nflying within 132,252 kilometers (82,178 miles) of the planet\\'s\\nbanded cloud tops. Pioneer 11 followed a year later. Voyagers 1\\nand 2 were launched in the summer of 1977 and returned\\nspectacular photographs of Jupiter and its family of satellites\\nduring flybys in 1979.\\n\\n     These travelers found Jupiter to be a whirling ball of\\nliquid hydrogen and helium, topped with a colorful atmosphere\\ncomposed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium. Ammonia ice\\ncrystals form white Jovian clouds. Sulfur compounds (and perhaps\\nphosphorus) may produce the brown and orange hues that\\ncharacterize Jupiter\\'s atmosphere.\\n\\n     It is likely that methane, ammonia, water and other gases\\nreact to form organic molecules in the regions between the\\nplanet\\'s frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lying\\nbelow. Because of Jupiter\\'s atmospheric dynamics, however, these\\norganic compounds -- if they exist -- are probably short-lived.\\n\\n     The Great Red Spot has been observed for centuries through\\ntelescopes on Earth. This hurricane-like storm in Jupiter\\'s\\natmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet. As a\\nhigh-pressure region, the Great Red Spot spins in a direction\\nopposite to that of low-pressure storms on Jupiter; it is\\nsurrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot and\\nare sometimes consumed by it. The Great Red Spot might be a\\nmillion years old.\\n\\n     Our spacecraft detected lightning in Jupiter\\'s upper\\natmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to Earth\\'s\\nnorthern lights at the Jovian polar regions. Voyager 1 returned\\nthe first images of a faint, narrow ring encircling Jupiter.\\n\\n     Largest of the solar system\\'s planets, Jupiter rotates at a\\ndizzying pace -- once every 9 hours 55 minutes 30 seconds. The\\nmassive planet takes almost 12 Earth years to complete a journey\\naround the Sun. With 16 known moons, Jupiter is something of a\\nminiature solar system.\\n\\n     A new mission to Jupiter -- the Galileo Project -- is under\\nway. After a six- year cruise that takes the Galileo Orbiter once\\npast Venus, twice past Earth and the Moon and once past two\\nasteroids, the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into\\nJupiter\\'s cloud layers and relay data back to Earth. The Galileo\\nOrbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying close\\nto Jupiter\\'s large moons, exploring in detail what the two\\nPioneers and two Voyagers revealed.\\n     \\n\\nGalilean Satellites\\n\\n     In 1610, Galileo Galilei aimed his telescope at Jupiter and\\nspotted four points of light orbiting the planet. For the first\\ntime, humans had seen the moons of another world. In honor of\\ntheir discoverer, these four bodies would become known as the\\nGalilean satellites or moons. But Galileo might have happily\\ntraded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographs\\nreturned by the Voyager spacecraft as they flew past these\\nplanet-sized satellites.\\n\\n     One of the most remarkable findings of the Voyager mission\\nwas the presence of active volcanoes on the Galilean moon Io.\\nVolcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a world\\nother than Earth. The Voyager cameras identified at least nine\\nactive volcanoes on Io, with plumes of ejected material extending\\nas far as 280 kilometers (175 miles) above the moon\\'s surface.\\n\\n     Io\\'s pizza-colored terrain, marked by orange and yellow\\nhues, is probably the result of sulfur-rich materials brought to\\nthe surface by volcanic activity. Volcanic activity on this\\nsatellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by the\\ngravitational tug-of-war between Io, Jupiter and the other three\\nGalilean moons.\\n\\n     Europa, approximately the same size as our Moon, is the\\nbrightest Galilean satellite. The moon\\'s surface displays a\\ncomplex array of streaks, indicating the crust has been\\nfractured. Caught in a gravitational tug-of-war like Io, Europa\\nhas been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt --\\napparently producing a liquid-water ocean. This ocean is covered\\nby an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to the\\ncold of space. Europa\\'s core is made of rock that sank to its\\ncenter.\\n\\n     Like Europa, the other two Galilean moons -- Ganymede and\\nCallisto -- are worlds of ice and rock. Ganymede is the largest\\nsatellite in the solar system -- larger than the planets Mercury\\nand Pluto. The satellite is composed of about 50 percent water or\\nice and the rest rock. Ganymede\\'s surface has areas of different\\nbrightness, indicating that, in the past, material oozed out of\\nthe moon\\'s interior and was deposited at various locations on the\\nsurface.\\n\\n     Callisto, only slightly smaller than Ganymede, has the\\nlowest density of any Galilean satellite, suggesting that large\\namounts of water are part of its composition. Callisto is the\\nmost heavily cratered object in the solar system; no activity\\nduring its history has erased old craters except more impacts.\\n\\n     Detailed studies of all the Galilean satellites will be\\nperformed by the Galileo Orbiter.\\n     \\n\\nSaturn\\n\\n     No planet in the solar system is adorned like Saturn. Its\\nexquisite ring system is unrivaled. Like Jupiter, Saturn is\\ncomposed mostly of hydrogen. But in contrast to the vivid colors\\nand wild turbulence found in Jovian clouds, Saturn\\'s atmosphere\\nhas a more subtle, butterscotch hue, and its markings are muted\\nby high-altitude haze. Given Saturn\\'s somewhat placid-looking\\nappearance, scientists were surprised at the high-velocity\\nequatorial jet stream that blows some 1,770 kilometers (1,100\\nmiles) per hour.\\n\\n     Three American spacecraft have visited Saturn. Pioneer 11\\nsped by the planet and its moon Titan in September 1979,\\nreturning the first close-up images. Voyager 1 followed in\\nNovember 1980, sending back breathtaking photographs that\\nrevealed for the first time the complexities of Saturn\\'s ring\\nsystem and moons. Voyager 2 flew by the planet and its moons in\\nAugust 1981.\\n\\n     The rings are composed of countless low-density particles\\norbiting individually around Saturn\\'s equator at progressive\\ndistances from the cloud tops. Analysis of spacecraft radio waves\\npassing through the rings showed that the particles vary widely\\nin size, ranging from dust to house-sized boulders. The rings are\\nbright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock.\\n\\n     The rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing body\\nventured too close to Saturn. The unlucky object would have been\\ntorn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in its\\ninterior. Or the object may not have been fully formed to begin\\nwith and disintegrated under the influence of Saturn\\'s gravity. A\\nthird possibility is that the object was shattered by collisions\\nwith larger objects orbiting the planet.\\n\\n     Unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each\\nother, individual ring particles appear to be held in place by\\nthe gravitational pull of Saturn and its satellites. These\\ncomplex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringlets\\nthat make up the major rings.\\n\\n     Radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an AM\\ncar radio during an electrical storm were detected by the Voyager\\nspacecraft. These emissions are typical of lightning but are\\nbelieved to be coming from Saturn\\'s ring system rather than its\\natmosphere, where no lightning was observed. As they had at\\nJupiter, the Voyagers saw a version of Earth\\'s auroras near\\nSaturn\\'s poles.\\n\\n     The Voyagers discovered new moons and found several\\nsatellites that share the same orbit. We learned that some moons\\nshepherd ring particles, maintaining Saturn\\'s rings and the gaps\\nin the rings. Saturn\\'s 18th moon was discovered in 1990 from\\nimages taken by Voyager 2 in 1981. \\n\\n     Voyager 1 determined that Titan has a nitrogen-based\\natmosphere with methane and argon -- one more like Earth\\'s in\\ncomposition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of Mars and\\nVenus. Titan\\'s surface temperature of -179 degrees Celsius (-290\\ndegrees Fahrenheit) implies that there might be water-ice islands\\nrising above oceans of ethane-methane liquid or sludge.\\nUnfortunately, Voyager\\'s cameras could not penetrate the moon\\'s\\ndense clouds.\\n\\n     Continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be\\nconverting Titan\\'s methane to ethane, acetylene and -- in\\ncombination with nitrogen -- hydrogen cyanide. The latter\\ncompound is a building block of amino acids. These conditions may\\nbe similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval Earth\\nbetween three and four billion years ago. However, Titan\\'s\\natmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permit\\nprogress beyond this stage of organic chemistry.\\n\\n     The exploration of Saturn will continue with the Cassini\\nmission. The Cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will\\nalso deploy a probe called Huygens, which will be dropped into\\nTitan\\'s atmosphere and fall to the surface. Cassini will use the\\nprobe as well as radar to peer through Titan\\'s clouds and will\\nspend years examining the Saturnian system.\\n     \\n\\nUranus\\n\\n     In January 1986, four and a half years after visiting\\nSaturn, Voyager 2 completed the first close-up survey of the\\nUranian system. The brief flyby revealed more information about\\nUranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned from\\nground observations since the planet\\'s discovery over two\\ncenturies ago by the English astronomer William Herschel.\\n\\n     Uranus, third largest of the planets, is an oddball of the\\nsolar system. Unlike the other planets (with the exception of\\nPluto), this giant lies tipped on its side with its north and\\nsouth poles alternately facing the sun during an 84-year swing\\naround the solar system. During Voyager 2\\'s flyby, the south pole\\nfaced the Sun. Uranus might have been knocked over when an\\nEarth-sized object collided with it early in the life of the\\nsolar system.\\n\\n     Voyager 2 found that Uranus\\' magnetic field does not follow\\nthe usual north-south axis found on the other planets. Instead,\\nthe field is tilted 60 degrees and offset from the planet\\'s\\ncenter, a phenomenon that on Earth would be like having one\\nmagnetic pole in New York City and the other in the city of\\nDjakarta, on the island of Java in Indonesia.\\n\\n     Uranus\\' atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen, with some 12\\npercent helium and small amounts of ammonia, methane and water\\nvapor. The planet\\'s blue color occurs because methane in its\\natmosphere absorbs all other colors. Wind speeds range up to 580\\nkilometers (360 miles) per hour, and temperatures near the cloud\\ntops average -221 degrees Celsius (-366 degrees Fahrenheit).\\n\\n     Uranus\\' sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind of\\nphotochemical \"smog\" believed to be a combination of acetylene,\\nethane and other sunlight-generated chemicals. Surrounding the\\nplanet\\'s atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers into\\nspace is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as \"electroglow.\"\\n\\n     Approximately 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) below Uranus\\'\\ncloud tops, there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water and\\ndissolved ammonia some 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) deep.\\nBeneath this ocean is an Earth-sized core of heavier materials.\\n\\n     Voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons, 16-169 kilometers (10-105\\nmiles) in diameter, orbiting Uranus. The five previously known --\\nMiranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon -- range in size from\\n520 to 1,610 kilometers (323 to 1,000 miles) across. Representing\\na geological showcase, these five moons are half-ice, half-rock\\nspheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of past\\nactivity, including faulting and ice flows.\\n\\n     The most remarkable of Uranus\\' moons is Miranda. Its surface\\nfeatures high cliffs as well as canyons, crater-pocked plains and\\nwinding valleys. The sharp variations in terrain suggest that,\\nafter the moon formed, it was smashed apart by a collision with\\nanother body -- an event not unusual in our solar system, which\\ncontains many objects that have impact craters or are fragments\\nfrom large impacts. What is extraordinary is that Miranda\\napparently reformed with some of the material that had been in\\nits interior exposed on its surface.\\n\\n     Uranus was thought to have nine dark rings; Voyager 2 imaged\\n11. In contrast to Saturn\\'s rings, which are composed of bright\\nparticles, Uranus\\' rings are primarily made up of dark,\\nboulder-sized chunks.\\n     \\n\\nNeptune\\n\\n     Voyager 2 completed its 12-year tour of the solar system\\nwith an investigation of Neptune and the planet\\'s moons. On\\nAugust 25, 1989, the spacecraft swept to within 4,850 kilometers\\n(3,010 miles) of Neptune and then flew on to the moon Triton.\\nDuring the Neptune encounter it became clear that the planet\\'s\\natmosphere was more active than Uranus\\'. \\n\\n     Voyager 2 observed the Great Dark Spot, a circular storm the\\nsize of Earth, in Neptune\\'s atmosphere. Resembling Jupiter\\'s\\nGreat Red Spot, the storm spins counterclockwise and moves\\nwestward at almost 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) per hour. Voyager\\n2 also noted a smaller dark spot and a fast-moving cloud dubbed\\nthe \"Scooter,\" as well as high-altitude clouds over the main\\nhydrogen and helium cloud deck. The highest wind speeds of any\\nplanet were observed, up to 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) per\\nhour.\\n\\n     Like the other giant planets, Neptune has a gaseous hydrogen\\nand helium upper layer over a liquid interior. The planet\\'s core\\ncontains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the\\nother gas giants. Neptune\\'s distinctive blue appearance, like\\nUranus\\' blue color, is due to atmospheric methane.\\n\\n     Neptune\\'s magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet\\'s\\nspin axis and is not centered at the core. This phenomenon is\\nsimilar to Uranus\\' magnetic field and suggests that the fields of\\nthe two giants are being generated in an area above the cores,\\nwhere the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the\\nelectrical properties of a metal. Earth\\'s magnetic field, on the\\nother hand, is produced by its spinning metallic core and is only\\nslightly tilted and offset relative to its center.\\n\\n     Voyager 2 also shed light on the mystery of Neptune\\'s rings.\\nObservations from Earth indicated that there were arcs of\\nmaterial in orbit around the giant planet. It was not clear how\\nNeptune could have arcs and how these could be kept from\\nspreading out into even, unclumped rings. Voyager 2 detected\\nthese arcs, but they were, in fact, part of thin, complete rings.\\nA number of small moons could explain the arcs, but such bodies\\nwere not spotted.\\n\\n     Astronomers had identified the Neptunian moons Triton in\\n1846 and Nereid in 1949. Voyager 2 found six more. One of the new\\nmoons -- Proteus -- is actually larger than Nereid, but since\\nProteus orbits close to Neptune, it was lost in the planet\\'s\\nglare for observers on Earth.\\n\\n      Triton circles Neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six\\ndays. Tidal forces on Triton are causing it to spiral slowly\\ntowards the planet. In 10 to 100 million years (a short time in\\nastronomical terms), the moon will be so close that Neptunian\\ngravity will tear it apart, forming a spectacular ring to\\naccompany the planet\\'s modest current rings.\\n\\n     Triton\\'s landscape is as strange and unexpected as those of\\nIo and Miranda. The moon has more rock than its counterparts at\\nSaturn and Uranus. Triton\\'s mantle is probably composed of\\nwater-ice, but the moon\\'s crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and\\nmethane. The moon shows two dramatically different types of\\nterrain: the so-called \"cantaloupe\" terrain and a receding ice\\ncap. \\n\\n     Dark streaks appear on the ice cap. These streaks are the\\nfallout from geyser-like volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gas\\nand dark, fine-grained particles to heights of 2 to 8 kilometers\\n(1 to 5 miles). Triton\\'s thin atmosphere, only 1/70,000th as\\nthick as Earth\\'s, has winds that carry the dark particles and\\ndeposit them as streaks on the ice cap -- the coldest surface yet\\nfound in the solar system (-235 degrees Celsius, -391 degrees\\nFahrenheit). Triton might be more like Pluto than any other\\nobject spacecraft have so far visited.\\n     \\n\\nPluto\\n\\n     Pluto is the most distant of the planets, yet the\\neccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it inside\\nNeptune\\'s orbit, where it has been since 1979 and where it will\\nremain until March 1999. Pluto\\'s orbit is also highly inclined --\\ntilted 17 degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets.\\n\\n     Discovered in 1930, Pluto appears to be little more than a\\ncelestial snowball. The planet\\'s diameter is calculated to be\\napproximately 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles), only two-thirds the\\nsize of our Moon. Ground-based observations indicate that Pluto\\'s\\nsurface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thin\\natmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planet\\nmoves away from the Sun. Observations also show that Pluto\\'s spin\\naxis is tipped by 122 degrees. \\n\\n     The planet has one known satellite, Charon, discovered in\\n1978. Charon\\'s surface composition is different from Pluto\\'s: the\\nmoon appears to be covered with water-ice rather than methane\\nice. Its orbit is gravitationally locked with Pluto, so both\\nbodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other. Pluto\\'s\\nand Charon\\'s rotational period and Charon\\'s period of revolution\\nare all 6.4 Earth days. \\n\\n     Although no spacecraft have ever visited Pluto, NASA is\\ncurrently exploring the possibility of such a mission.\\n     \\n\\nComets\\n\\n     The outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay a\\nvisit to the inner planets. As asteroids are the rocky and\\nmetallic remnants of the formation of the solar system, comets\\nare the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only\\nfar from the Sun. Most comet nuclei reside in the Oort Cloud, a\\nloose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reaching\\nperhaps halfway to the nearest star.\\n\\n     Comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they are\\ngravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them close\\nto the Sun. As a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outer\\nplanets, the volatile elements of which it is made gradually\\nwarm; by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner\\nplanets, these volatile elements are boiling. The nucleus itself\\nis irregular and only a few miles across, and is made principally\\nof water-ice with methane and ammonia -- materials very similar\\nto those composing the moons of the giant planets.\\n\\n     As these materials boil off of the nucleus, they form a coma\\nor cloud-like \"head\" that can measure tens of thousands of\\nkilometers across. The coma grows as the comet gets closer to the\\nSun. The stream of charged particles coming from the Sun pushes\\non this cloud, blowing it back like a flag in the wind and giving\\nrise to the comet\\'s \"tails.\" Gases and ions are blown directly\\nback from the nucleus, but dust particles are pushed more slowly.\\nAs the nucleus continues in its orbit, the dust particles are\\nleft behind in a curved arc.\\n\\n     Both the gas and dust tails point away from the Sun; in\\neffect, the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the Sun.\\nThe tails can reach 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) in\\nlength, but the total amount of material contained in this\\ndramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase. Comets --\\nfrom the Latin cometa, meaning \"long-haired\" -- are essentially\\ndramatic light shows.\\n\\n     Some comets pass through the solar system only once, but\\nothers have their orbits gravitationally modified by a close\\nencounter with one of the giant outer planets. These latter\\nvisitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly return\\nto the inner solar system.\\n\\n     Halley\\'s Comet is the most famous example of a relatively\\nshort period comet, returning on an average of once every 76\\nyears and orbiting from beyond Neptune to within Venus\\' orbit.\\nConfirmed sightings of the comet go back to 240 B.C. This regular\\nvisitor to our solar system is named for Sir Edmond Halley,\\nbecause he plotted the comet\\'s orbit and predicted its return,\\nbased on earlier sightings and Newtonian laws of motion. His name\\nbecame part of astronomical lore when, in 1759, the comet\\nreturned on schedule. Unfortunately, Sir Edmond did not live to\\nsee it.\\n\\n     A comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passes\\ncomparatively close to Earth. Unfortunately, on its most recent\\nappearance, Halley\\'s Comet passed no closer than 62.4 million\\nkilometers (38.8 million miles) from our world. The comet was\\nvisible to the naked eye, especially for viewers in the southern\\nhemisphere, but it was not spectacular. Comets have been so\\nbright, on rare occasions, that they were visible during daytime.\\nHistorically, comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omens\\nand have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky.\\n\\n     The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) spacecraft will\\nbecome the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and\\nremain in proximity to it as they both approach the Sun. CRAF\\nwill observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing\\nsunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and\\nform a coma and tails. Several spacecraft have flown by comets at\\nhigh speed; the first was NASA\\'s International Cometary Explorer\\nin 1985. An armada of five spacecraft (two Japanese, two Soviet\\nand the Giotto spacecraft from the European Space Agency) flew by\\nHalley\\'s Comet in 1986.\\n     \\n\\nConclusion\\n\\n     Despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances of\\nspace through an obscuring atmosphere, scientists of the past had\\nonly one body they could study closely -- Earth. But since 1959,\\nspaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on our\\nneighbors in space. \\n\\n     We have learned more about our solar system and its members\\nthan anyone had in the previous thousands of years. Our automated\\nspacecraft have traveled to the Moon and to all the planets\\nbeyond our world except Pluto; they have observed moons as large\\nas small planets, flown by comets and sampled the solar\\nenvironment. Astronomy books now include detailed pictures of\\nbodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes for\\ngenerations. We are lucky to be alive now to see these strange\\nand beautiful places and objects.\\n\\n     The knowledge gained from our journeys through the solar\\nsystem has redefined traditional Earth sciences like geology and\\nmeteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline called\\ncomparative planetology. By studying the geology of planets,\\nmoons, asteroids and comets, and comparing differences and\\nsimilarities, we are learning more about the origin and history\\nof these bodies and the solar system as a whole.\\n\\n     We are also gaining insight into Earth\\'s complex weather\\nsystems. By seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and by\\ninvestigating the Sun\\'s activity and its influence throughout the\\nsolar system, we can better understand climatic conditions and\\nprocesses on Earth.\\n\\n     We will continue to learn and benefit as our automated\\nspacecraft explore our neighborhood in space. One current mission\\nis mapping Venus; others are flying between worlds and will reach\\nthe Sun and Jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments. Future\\nmissions are planned for Mars, Saturn, a comet and the asteroid\\nbelt.\\n\\n     We can also look forward to the time when humans will once\\nagain set foot on an alien world. Although astronauts have not\\nbeen back to the Moon since December 1972, plans are being\\nformulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for the\\nhuman exploration of Mars and even the establishment of martian\\noutposts. One day, taking a holiday may mean spending a week at a\\nlunar base or a martian colony!',\n",

       " \"Yesterday, I went to the Boeing shareholders meeting.  It was a bit shorter\\nthan I expected.  Last year (when the stock was first down), they made a big\\npresentation on the 777, and other programs.  This year, it was much more\\nbare-bones.\\n\\nIn any case, I wanted to ask a question that the board of directors would\\nhear, and so I got there early, and figured that If I didn't get to the mike,\\nmaybe they would read mine off of a card, and so I wrote it down, and handed it\\nin.\\n\\nAfter the meeting started, Mr. Shrontz said that he would only answer written\\nquestions, in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only\\nhad monitors downstairs.  Naturally, I was crushed.\\n\\nSo, when question and answer time came, I was suprised to find my question\\nbeing read and answered.  Admittedly near the end of the ones that he took.\\nPresumably getting there early, and getting the question in early made all\\nthe difference.\\n\\nSo, on to the substance. The question was \\n\\nIs Boeing looking at anything BEYOND the high speed Civil Transport, such\\nas a commercial space launch system, and if not, how will Boeing compete\\nwith the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed\\nby Mcdonnell Douglass?\\n\\nWell, he read it without a hitch, and without editing, with impressed me,\\nthen he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question, last\\npart first.\\n\\nThis is to the best of my recollection what he said.\\n\\nAs far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have a better\\nanswer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some of our customers \\nabout that.  As far as commercialization, that is a long ways off.  The High\\nspeed Civil Transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at\\nthis point.\\n\\nSo, this tells me that Boeing still considers space to be a non-commercial\\narena, and for the most part this is true, however it also tells me that \\nthey consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them\\nto persue work on their own.\\n\\nNow, I do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing.

       " 'I hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesment\\nof WFAN and WIP(I go to school in Philadelphia, and I listen to\\nboth stations on a consistant basis.)  Now that the fan has Mike\\nLupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the \\nbig name guests for interviews, and not just of local importance\\nHe did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he \\nhad Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too.  \\n  Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent:\\nMorning show:\\n  In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi, \\nand Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morganti\\nhad a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP tries\\nto copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms of\\nsports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he\\ninterjects humor and politics into his show.\\n10 AM to 12 Noon:\\n  I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their\\nabilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the\\nadvantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller\\nwho is asking about who the local team is going to draft\\nin the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get\\nbetter interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that\\nthey were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless\\nit was a major story.\\n  I would consider this even because they are two different\\nstyles of host.\\n\\n12 Noon to 2 PM:\\n  At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to \\nJody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been\\non for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the ability\\nto transcend the \"homer\" mentality of the Philadelphia fan\\nbase.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia \\nspelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan.\\nWhere else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0\\nscore without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning \\'guys\\')\\nI do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight\\nand I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating\\nhosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on \\neither station by a good margin.  If you are in NY and\\nyou can\\'t get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.\\n\\n2PM to 4PM:\\n  This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and \\nRusso(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most divided\\nin my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining,\\nbut they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10\\nto 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD do\\nget great guests and that is the basis for their show, so\\nit is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is the\\nappearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, which\\nare often hilarious.  \\n\\n4 PM to 7 PM:\\n  MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I like\\nMike Missanelli but I just can\\'t stomach Steve Fredericks.  \\nI know that SF came from Philly originally, but when he\\nwas at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly\\nhomer now.  I don\\'t listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there\\nis a game on that night, but you will see later for the \\nreason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.\\n\\n7 PM to Midnight:\\n  S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes\\nEli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on\\ncharges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on my\\nnerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go\\nnuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show)\\nOn FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, Mets\\nJets, or St. John\\'s basketball.  If the game is on the\\nwest coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of course\\nI think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, but\\nWIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season.\\n(If this is the sports station, why did they lose the\\nIGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.))\\nDuring the summer, it\\nis all talk on WIP.\\n\\n\\nOverall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, with\\nthe exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and\\n12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.   \\n\\n\\n\\n            Rich',\n",

Shaw  chairs the undergraduate  interdepartmental degree\\nprogram in Near Eastern Studies and has organized the Program for\\nthe Study of Ottoman and Turkish Jewry. He is affiliated with the\\nG. E. von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern Studies.\\n\\nEditor: How did  you come to write these two  books on Turkey and\\nEuropean and Turkish Jews?\\n\\nShaw: Basically, I\\'m  an Ottoman historian, but  I\\'m also Jewish.\\nI\\'ve  spent twenty-five  years studying  Ottoman history,  and as\\ntime went along, whenever I  found materials on the Ottoman Jews,\\nI collected  them. But  I never  did anything  with them  until a\\ncouple of years  ago, when I suddenly realized that  1992 was the\\n500th  anniversary of  the  Jews being  expelled  from Spain  and\\ncoming  to Turkey.  Then the  Sephardic Temple  down on  Wilshire\\nAvenue invited me  to give a series of three  lectures on Ottoman\\nJewry.  These lectures  were  greatly appreciated,  and I  became\\nmotivated to  undertake further research  to develop a  book, The\\nJews of the  Ottoman Empire and the Turkish)  Republic. This book\\nis quite different from the  works of most Jewish historians, who\\ntend to look  at the Jews in any country  more from the viewpoint\\nof the Jews  and the Jewish community, and rely  mainly on Jewish\\nsources.  I  view my  subject  as  an  Ottoman historian,  and  I\\napproach the Jews of the Ottoman Empire largely from the point of\\nview of Ottoman  society, using largely Ottoman  sources. After I\\nfinished  this book  and  sent it  to the  press,  I came  across\\nadditional documents  relating to  Turkish Jews during  World War\\nII. In the completed book, I had said that Turkey had done a good\\ndeal  to rescue  the Jews  during  World War  II, but  I did  not\\nactually have many details. Then I  found a batch of documents in\\nthe Foreign Ministry archive relating to actions taken by Turkish\\ndiplomats to  help the Jews  before and during the  Holocaust. It\\nwas too late to add this new information to the book in press, so\\nI decided to  write a second book. I  conducted further research,\\nmainly in the archives of the  Foreign Ministry in Ankara and the\\nTurkish Embassy and Consulate in Paris. The result was the second\\nbook, Turkey and  the Holocaust, which details  how Turkey helped\\nrescue Jews from the Nazis.\\n\\n- How exactly did they do this?\\n\\nThe story takes  place over a number of years.  The book presents\\nthe material in three parts, first of which deals with the period\\nbefore the Holocaust. When the Nazis  came to power in Germany in\\n1933,  they immediately  started  dismissing  Jews and  anti-Nazi\\nGermans from universities,  hospitals, scientific institutes, and\\nthe like. Turkey at that moment was just beginning the process of\\nreforming its  universities, and it  saw in these Jews,  who were\\nbeing fired from their positions in Germany, a good source of new\\ntalent to  help modernize the Turkish  universities. Within three\\nmonths  after the  Nazis  started dismissing  these Jews,  Turkey\\narranged to take many of them in. They were brought to Turkey and\\nwere   given   appointments   as  professors   in   the   Turkish\\nuniversities, as  heads of scientific institutes,  and as medical\\npersonnel in hospitals. About 300  to 500 major Jewish professors\\ncame to  Turkey in  the 1930s. Ernst  Reuter, a  German political\\nscientist,  spent the  war  years teaching  political science  in\\nTurkey. After  World War II,  he was  mayor of Berlin  during the\\nBerlin Airlift.  Fritz Neimark, a major  German Jewish economist,\\ncame to Turkey and helped  establish a modern school of economics\\nin Istanbul.  A man named  Reichenbach, who was rescued  from the\\nNazis by  Turkey and  spent the war  years in  Turkey, eventually\\ncame to  UCLA, where he  became a professor of  philosophy. Other\\nGerman Jewish  emigres engaged in cultural  activities in Turkey.\\nOne  such was  Karl  Ebert,  who had  been  a leading  theatrical\\nproducer in Berlin until he was expelled by the Nazis. He went to\\nTurkey, where he  organized the Turkish National  Theater and the\\nTurkish National Opera  Company in Ankara, with the  help of Paul\\nHindemuth. So  the first  section of the  book covers  this first\\nphase, when Jews were being  persecuted in Germany and rescued by\\nTurkey.  Oddly enough,  the  German emigres,  when  they were  in\\nTurkey, did not seem to think too badly of Germany. They regarded\\nthemselves more  as Germans than Jews,  and they did not  join in\\nthe anti-Nazi activities of the local Turkish Jewish community. I\\neven  found  letters  from  the Nazi  representatives  to  Turkey\\npraising these German Jewish refugees for their work in promoting\\nthe idea  of German  culture. Even though  these people  had been\\npersecuted by the Nazis and rescued by the Turks, they shared the\\nNazis\\' feelings of  Aryan racial superiority over  the Turks. The\\nsecond part of the book deals  with the Holocaust, which began in\\n1940 when the Nazis occupied France.  In Europe at that time, and\\nespecially in France, there were  about 20,000 Turkish Jews. They\\nhad migrated to Europe for various reasons from about the turn of\\nthe century onward. Most of them had settled in Europe during the\\nTurkish war for  independence after World War I,  when Greece was\\nthreatening to overrun Turkey. The Greeks had persecuted the Jews\\nthroughout the nineteenth century, and the Jews feared what might\\nhappen to them if the Greeks  took over in Turkey. Many Jews fled\\nto France during  the 1920s and 1930s. Many  also abandoned their\\nTurkish  citizenship and  became  French  citizens. Suddenly  the\\nNazis invaded France in 1940 and started introducing all sorts of\\nanti-Jewish laws.  The Turkish  Jews soon found  that it  was not\\nworth very much to  be a French Jew, but that it  was worth a lot\\nto be a Turkish Jew.\\n\\n- How so?\\n\\nTurkey remained neutral through most of World War II. It retained\\nits embassies  and consulates in all  the Nazi-occupied countries\\nuntil it finally entered the war on the side of the Allies at the\\nend of 1944. During the war,  therefore, Turkey was in a position\\nto  defend its  citizens  against anti-Jewish  measures, and  the\\nactions that  Turkish diplomats took  form the second  chapter of\\nthe  book. Turkish  diplomats  who were  stationed  in France  in\\nparticular intervened to protect Jews of Turkish citizenship from\\nthe Nazis. For those Turkish  Jews who had retained their Turkish\\ncitizenship,  there  was  generally  no  problem.  If  they  were\\narrested and sent to a  concentration camp, the Turkish diplomats\\nwould  communicate with  the  commanders of  the  camp and  other\\nofficials and say in effect:  \"These people are Turkish citizens.\\nYou  can\\'t do  this  to  them.\" And  the  Turkish  Jews would  be\\nreleased.  If  their  businesses were  confiscated,  the  Turkish\\ndiplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored.\\n\\nThe Nazis  in general  wanted to keep  the friendship  of Turkey.\\nThey hoped to be able to use  Turkey as a gateway for an invasion\\nof the Middle  East, and they also wanted to  obtain chromium and\\nmanganese from Turkey. In order  to keep Turkish friendship, they\\nusually accepted  these interventions on behalf  of Turkish Jews.\\nThe Turkish  diplomats sometimes went to  the concentration camps\\nto secure the release of Turkish Jews. At times they even boarded\\ntrains hauling  Turkish Jews  to Auschwitz for  extermination and\\nsucceeded in getting them off the train. Most of the foreign Jews\\nwere sent  to a concentration  camp at  a place called  Drancy in\\nParis,  and that\\'s  where  most of  the  intercession by  Turkish\\nconsuls took place.\\n\\nThe greater problem came with  the Turkish Jews who had abandoned\\ntheir  Turkish citizenship  and had  become French  citizens. The\\nconsuls couldn\\'t declare that  these people were Turkish citizens\\nbecause  they were  not.  My book  includes  photographs of  Jews\\nlining  up in  front  of  the Turkish  consulate,  either to  get\\npassports to  return to Turkey or  to get a restoration  of their\\nTurkish  citizenship.   This  was   a  bureaucratic   matter,  so\\nprocessing the application would take  some time. In the meantime\\nit was a  real emergency, because the Nazis would  arrest Jews on\\nthe streets for almost nothing.  The Nazis would even arrest them\\nif they  had radios  or telephones  in their  apartments, because\\nradios and  telephones were  forbidden to Jews.  To take  care of\\nthese  former  Turkish Jews,  the  Turkish  diplomats invented  a\\ndocument called  gayri muntazem  vatandash, or  \"irregular fellow\\ncitizen.\" The  document said in  effect \"This person is  a former\\nTurkish  citizen  who has  applied  for  the restoration  of  his\\nTurkish citizenship.  In the meantime  we would appreciate  it if\\nyou  would treat  him  as  if he  were  a  Turkish citizen.\"  The\\ndiplomats wrote  the document in  Turkish and put their  seals on\\nit. Since  the Nazis could  not read  Turkish, on the  whole they\\naccepted  these papers  as certificates  of citizenship.  By this\\nmeans, the  Turkish diplomats were  able to rescue many  Jews who\\nhad relinquished their Turkish citizenship.\\n\\nActually the Nazis were of two minds about the Turkish defense of\\nJews. On the one hand the  Nazi Foreign Ministry, which wanted to\\nretain the friendship of Turkey,  was in favor of accepting these\\ninterventions. On the other hand, Himmler and Eichmann wanted all\\nJews exterminated.  At times  Himmler and  Eichmann were  able to\\nprevail and some  of the Turkish Jews were sent  off to Auschwitz\\nbefore the Turkish consuls could do anything.\\n\\n- Do you have statistics on how many Turkish Jews were rescued?\\n\\nThere were about  20,000 Turkish Jews in Europe  before world War\\nII,  about 10,000  of whom  were living  in France.  Most of  the\\ninformation in this section of  the book relates to the situation\\nin France. I have published  the letters that the Turkish consuls\\nsent to  the Nazi  officials and  the letters  that came  back in\\nreply. Generally the Nazis said  that if the Turkish consul would\\npresent  documents  certifying   that  arrested  individuals  are\\nTurkish citizens,  and promise  to send them  out of  France, the\\nNazis would release them from the concentration camp. The Turkish\\nconsuls also organized  special trains to take  Turkish Jews from\\nNazi-occupied  territory   back  to  Turkey.  These   trains  ran\\nregularly in 1943 and 1944. The Nazis gave the Turkish Jews visas\\nso they  could pass out  of Nazi  territory, but the  trains were\\noften  held  up by  the  Nazi-influenced  governments of  Eastern\\nEurope  -   Croatia,  Serbia,   and  Bulgaria  -   because  these\\ngovernments really didn\\'t want the Jews to escape. As a result of\\nthe Turkish consuls\\' efforts, about 3,000 to 4,000 of the Turkish\\nJews  in  France were  saved.  Another  3,000  were sent  off  to\\nAuschwitz, where  most of them  died. The remaining  3,000 either\\nescaped  across the  border into  Spain or  fled to  the area  of\\nsouthern France occupied  by the Italians, who  treated Jews much\\nbetter than  the Nazis did.  At the  end of 1943,  however, Italy\\nfell out of the war, and that was the end for those Jews as well.\\nIncidentally, the Turkish diplomats  in Nazi-occupied Greece also\\nworked to rescue Jews in that country.\\n\\n- The second part of your  book then deals with Turkish diplomats\\nacting to  rescue Jews of  Turkish citizenship or  Turkish origin\\nfrom Nazi persecution.\\n\\nYes,  and  there  is  an  aside   I  might  add  here:  In  their\\ninterventions on  behalf of Turkish  Jews, the Turks  cited their\\ntreaty with Germany which stated  that Turkish citizens in German\\nterritory would be treated the same as German citizens in Turkey.\\nOn  that basis  the Turks  maintained  that the  Nazis could  not\\ndiscriminate  against Turkish  citizens who  are Jews.  The Nazis\\nclaimed  (and the  Vichy government  agreed) that  they were  not\\ndiscriminating  because  they  were treating  all  Jews  equally.\\nTurkey  protested,   saying,  \"You  are  dividing   our  citizens\\naccording to religion, but the Turkish constitution requires that\\nall  citizens   be  treated  equally,  regardless   of  religion.\\nTherefore, you cannot single  out Turkish Jews.\" American consuls\\nin  Paris,  by contrast,  accepted  the  Nazi argument  and  told\\nAmerican Jews  who were being  persecuted by the Nazis  that they\\ncouldn\\'t do  anything about  it, because  the American  Jews were\\nbeing treated the same as other  Jews. The third part of the book\\ntakes place in Turkey, which  was the principal center during the\\nHolocaust for activities aimed at  the rescue of Eastern European\\nJews. The  kwish Agency, an  organization established by  Jews in\\nPalestine to help resettle Jews to Palestine, set up an office in\\nIstanbul  in 1940  under the  leadership of  Chaim Barlas.  Other\\nJewish organizations in Palestine, especially the kibbutzes, also\\nsent representatives  to Istanbul  to set up  headquarters. These\\ngroups first tried to contact Jews  in Eastern Europe to find out\\nwhat was  happening. Today  we know about  the Holocaust,  but at\\nthat  time people  didn\\'t know  what  was going  on. They  didn\\'t\\nimagine the Nazis could do the things they were doing. And so the\\nfirst step was to get information, and the Turkish government let\\nthem use the Turkish mails to send letters to their relatives and\\nfriends  in Eastern  Europe. The  Jewish organizations  found out\\nwhat was happening when they  received replies. Later on when the\\nNazis  began  to  intercept   such  letters,  the  Jews  received\\nassistance  also from  the  Vatican nuncio,  Angelo Roncali,  who\\nserved as  the Vatican  representative in  Istanbul from  1935 to\\n1944  and   later  became  Pope   John  XXIII.  As   the  Vatican\\nrepresentative  during the  war, he  used the  facilities of  the\\nCatholic  Church to  supplement what  the Turkish  government was\\ndoing to  assist Jewish  agencies in  contacting Jews  in Eastern\\nEurope.  With the  cooperation of  the Turkish  government, these\\nagencies  then  sent  hard  currency, food,  clothing,  and  even\\nrailroad  and  steamship  tickets   to  Jews  in  Czechoslovakia,\\nBulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. They weren\\'t able to help much in\\nPoland because  by then the  Nazis had  wiped out almost  all the\\nPolish Jews.  Whenever possible the rescue  agencies arranged for\\nthe Jews to get out of Eastern Europe either by train through the\\nso called  Orient Express route  to Istanbul, or by  boat through\\nthe Black Sea to Istanbul.\\n\\nTurkey was not eager for all  these refugees to remain within its\\nborders during  the war, because  it was being blockaded  and was\\nsuffering   terrible  shortages   of  food   and  clothing.   The\\ngovernment,   therefore,   facilitated   the  movement   of   the\\nnon-Turkish Jewish  refugees from Turkey to  Palestine, either by\\nthe Taurus  Express Railroad through  the mountains to  Syria and\\nPalestine,  or by  small boats  across the  eastern Mediterranean\\nfrom southern  Turkey to  Palestine. These efforts  were bitterly\\nopposed not only  by the Nazis, but also by  the British, who did\\nnot want  any more Jewish  immigration to Palestine  because they\\nfeared it would hurt their  relations with the Arabs. The British\\nconstantly pressured the Turkish  government to stop this traffic\\nand send those Jews back. In  a few cases the Turkish government,\\nyielding  to  British pressure,  did  send  the boats  back.  For\\nexample, in  one incident,  the steamship  Struma, with  some 700\\nJewish  refugees  from Romania,  was  sent  back by  the  Turkish\\ngovernment  as  a  result  of the  intervention  of  the  British\\nambassador. When  that ship was  sunk by a Soviet  submarine, all\\nwere lost except one person.  Nevertheless, all told, the Turkish\\ngovernment allowed no fewer than 100,000 Eastern European Jews to\\npass through  Turkish territory and  move on to  Palestine during\\nthe Second World War. The Turkish authorities also provided these\\nrefugees with facilities  and money, and gave  them permission to\\nsend money and food out of the country.\\n\\n- Many  of these  Jews who  passed  through Turkey  may still  be\\nliving in Israel.\\n\\nYes, and  their children. But  let\\'s return  for a moment  to the\\nfirst group, the Turkish Jews who  came from Europe. They did not\\ngo  on  to   Palestine;  they  stayed  in  Turkey.   It  was  the\\nnon-Turkish, Eastern  European Jews who passed  through Turkey en\\nroute to Palestine. Their story is very interesting.\\n\\n- And you have rescued it from obscurity.\\n\\nMany studies have been made of the Holocaust, but most of them do\\nnot focus on the Eastern European or Middle Eastern Jews. Most of\\nthe scholarship  has centered  on the  Western European  Jews, of\\nwhom 6 million were massacred by the Nazis. My study deals with a\\nmuch smaller  number of  people. I  have tried  to round  out the\\npicture,  and I  hope my  book  will persuade  other scholars  to\\nundertake further investigations in the history of Eastern Jews.\\n\\nWhen it  comes to numbers,  the German Jews were  also relatively\\nsmall in number. Most of the millions slain were Polish Jews. The\\nrescue  of  100,000  Eastern  European   Jews  may  not  seem  so\\nsignificant  compared  with  the  total of  6  million  who  were\\nmurdered, but it meant a lot to those who were saved.\\n\\nAbout  three-fourths   of  the  book  consists   of  documents  -\\ntranslations  of many  documents. They  are included  because the\\nstory is not well known. Not  only are people in the West unaware\\nof  the courageous  actions of  the Turkish  diplomats; even  the\\npeople of Turkey  did not know the story. I  felt that they would\\nnot  fully understand  this  remarkable  achievement unless  they\\ncould see the documents.\\n\\n- What languages are used in the documents?\\n\\nMost of them are in Turkish  or French; some are in Hebrew. There\\nis a great  deal of material in Hebrew about  the organization of\\nthe boats  going to Palestine, the  passengers, and so on,  but I\\ndid not go into those details extensively. I describe mostly what\\nTurkey did, so  most of my documents are in  Turkish or French. A\\nfew documents are  in English. The Jewish groups  in Istanbul did\\nnot necessarily  cooperate with  one another  to rescue  Jews; in\\nfact, they often fought with  one another. They took turns trying\\nto  get  the  Turkish  government to  deport  rival  groups.  For\\nexample, some of  the kibbutz groups felt that  the Jewish Agency\\nwas  run by  Western European  Jews who  were interested  only in\\nhelping  Western  European  Jews.  Finally,  in  1944,  President\\nRoosevelt sent a personal  representative, Ira Hirschman, who had\\nbeen an executive of Bloomingdale\\'s  department store in New York\\nCity, and  Hirschman managed to reconcile  their differences. The\\ndocuments related to his mission are in English.\\n\\nI also obtained many documents  from Serge Klarsfeld, a Holocaust\\nhistorian in France,  who mainly worked on the  French Jews. (His\\nfather was  killed by  the Nazis.)  He gave  me materials  he had\\ngathered in the German archives on  the Turkish Jews, so I didn\\'t\\npersonally consult the German archives.  I believe that much more\\ncan  be learned  from the  German  archives, and  I hope  someone\\nsomeday will make the effort.\\n\\n- This new book fits in well with your teaching, doesn\\'t it?\\n\\nRight. I\\'m  giving a  course on  the history of  the Jews  of the\\nOttoman  Empire.  I first  gave  the  course  two years  ago.  In\\naddition to  research, writing, and teaching,  I\\'ve been actively\\ninvolved in  the commemoration  of the  500th anniversary  of the\\ncoming of the  Jews to the Ottoman Empire. Among  other things, I\\nhelped organize  a large international conference  on the subject\\nwhich was held in Istanbul in 1992.\\n\\n- Now that your  books are finished and the  conference has taken\\nplace, what do you plan to do next?\\n\\nI\\'m working on two new books. One is a history of the Turkish War\\nfor Independence, which took place  after World War I, during the\\nyears  1918 to  1923. The  Turks warded  off the  efforts of  the\\nvictorious  European   powers  to  occupy  Turkey   and  end  its\\nindependence. The  second book is  a study of Sultan  Abdul Hamid\\nII, the last major sultan, who ruled from 1876 to 1909. He was an\\nimportant modernizer in his own  way, although he also suppressed\\nall sorts of political movements.\\n\\nStanford  J. Shaw  received  a B.A.  in History  and  an M.A.  in\\nBritish History. He then shifted to Near Eastern History, earning\\na second M.A.  and a Ph.D. at Princeton. As  a doctoral candidate\\nat Princeton, he  spent two years abroad, studying  at the School\\nof  Oriental  and  African  Studies, University  of  London;  the\\nUniversity of  Cairo, the American  University at Cairo,  and the\\nUniversity of  Istanbul. He  taught at  Harvard before  coming to\\nUCLA in 1966. His postdoctoral research has been supported by the\\nJohn Simon Guggenheim Foundation, the American Research Institute\\nin  Turkey, the  Social  Science Research  Council, the  National\\nEndowment for the Humanities, the Fulbright Program, and ISOP. He\\nhas  received  honorary  degrees   from  Harvard  University  and\\nBosporus University, Bebek, Istanbul, Turkey, and medals of honor\\nfor lifetime contributions  to the fields of  Islamic and Turkish\\nstudies from the Center for Research in Islamic History, Art, and\\nCulture in  Istanbul and from  the American Friends of  Turkey in\\nWashington,  D.C. In  addition to  undertaking many  professional\\nservice activities and public lectures  in both the United States\\nand Turkey,  Shaw has  also produced eight  books and  one edited\\nvolume. His  History of  the Ottoman Empire  and Modem  Turkey (2\\nvols.)  has been  published  in many  editions  (six editions  or\\nreprints  from 1977-1991),  and  translated  into Turkish  (1983,\\n1991) and French (1984). His book  The Jews of the Ottoman Empire\\nand  the  Turkish  Republic  (MacMillan,  London,  and  New  York\\nUniversity Press, 1992) will  be published in Turkish translation\\nby the Turkish  Historical Society, Istanbul. His  Turkey and the\\nHolocaust: Turkey\\'s  Role in Rescuing Turkish  and European Jewry\\nfrom Nazi  Persecution, 1933-1945 will be  published by Macmillan\\nPublishers,  London, and  New York  University Press  in 1993.

       " '\\nA number of points.  You are making assumptions about the manner\\nin which the cards are used.  True, by law, all residents, citizens,\\nand tourists must carry a form of identification with them.  For\\ncitizens, the standard ID is the ID card.  The purpose this serves\\non a daily basis, wherein they are presented at public places,\\nis for the purpose of identifying the bearer.  This takes place\\nin banks (cashing checks), post offices (registered mail and such), etc...\\nQuite frankly, it was rare that I ever had to present my ID card\\nfor such activities more than once per week.  There is no law or\\nrequirement that forces people to wave their ID cards in public.\\nFurthermore, none of the services I outlined discriminate against\\nthe bearer in any manner by having access to this information.\\n\\nThe only case that I can think of in which the Le\\'um field might\\nbe taken into account is during interaction with the police,\\nbased upon the scenario.  In general though, arab citizens are\\nclearly recognizable, as are non-arabs. Your argument therefore\\nbecomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field\\nis being used to discriminate against them officially.\\n\\n\\n\\nI take issue with your assertions.  I think that Arab countries\\ndo know that they have nothing to fear from \"Israeli expansionism\".\\nMilitarily, Israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts of\\nland under occupation to a hostile, armed, and insurgent population for a\\nsustained period of time.  As is, the intifada is heavily taxing\\nthe Israeli economy.  Proof of this can be seen in the Israeli\\nwithdrawal from Lebanon.  Israeli troops pulled back from the\\nAwali, and later from the Litani, in order to control the minimal\\nstrip needed to keep towns out of range of Katyusha missile fire.\\nPublic opinion in Israel has turned towards settling the intifada\\nvia territorial concessions.  The Israel public is sufferring from\\nbattle fatigue of sorts and the gov\\'t is aware of it.\\n\\nWith regards to borders, let me state the following.  I may not agree\\nwith the manner in which negotiations are being held, however the crux\\nof the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from stating\\na starting position.  The arab parties have called for total withdrawal\\nand a return to pre-48 borders.  If Israel were to state large borders,\\nthe negotiations might never get under way.  If Israel were to state\\nsmaller borders, then the arab countries might try and force even smaller\\nborders during the negotiations.  I think that leaving the matter to be\\nsettled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realistic\\nand sensible.\\n\\n\\nYour statement is typical of the simple minded naivety of a \"center for\\npolicy research\".  Whether or not all of Vanunu\\'s revelations were true has no\\nbearing on the fact that some were.  For disclosing \"state secrets\"\\nafter having signed contracts and forms with the understanding that\\nsaid secrets are not to be made public, one should be punished.\\nAs to which were and which weren\\'t, I am under no moral obligation\\nto disclose that - quite the reverse in fact.\\nHe was taken to court, tried, and found guilty.  You may take issue\\nwith a number of things but clearly you have no understanding of the\\nconcept of \"Secrets of state\", something which every democratic govt\\nhas.\\n\\n\\nI noticed that he was documenting the fact that such prisoners could exist\\nmore than he documented the fact that they do exist.  The CLU noted,\\nwhich you evidently did not pay attention to, that they know of no such\\nreports or cases.  I am sorry to tell you but in a country of 4 mill,\\nas tightly knit as Israel, even if the matter of the arrest was not\\nmade public, within a relatively short time frame, most people would know\\nabout it.  My own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should be\\nmade public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of X hours.\\nThis would be granted only if a judge could be convinced that an\\nannouncement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation.\\n\\n\\nWell, I am sorry to say that your questions are slanted.  Such\\nquestions are often termed \"tabloid journalism\" and are not\\ndisturbing because they avoid any attempt at objectivity.\\nSuch questions were often used during the McCarthy era as\\na basis for the witch-hunts that took place then.

Foreign policy decisions could not be \\nbased on street-level excitement, he said.\\n\\nThere was no immediate reaction in Ankara to regional reports, based on\\nArmenian sources in Yerevan, saying Turkish pilots and other officers were\\ncaptured when they were shot down flying Azerbaijani warplanes and \\nhelicopters.\\n\\nThe newspaper Cumhuriyet said Turkish troops were digging in along the border\\nwith Armenia, but military sources denied reports based on claims by local\\npeople that gunfire was heard along the border. No military action has \\noccurred, the sources said.\\n\\nThe latest upsurge in fighting between the Armenians and Azerbaijanis flared\\nearly this month when Armenian forces seized the town of Kelbajar and later\\npositioned themselves outside Fizuli, near the Iranian border.\\n\\n',\n",

While it doesn\\'t\\nhave the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling\\npoint for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.  \\n\\nThe overall car is a good buy for the money.

I drive it to and from work\\neach day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the\\nProbe\\'s suspension doesn\\'t like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a \\npotholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable.\\nIf you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They\\'ll find\\nthat they have no room in the back and you\\'ll find that the car rides\\ndifferently (if that\\'s \"better\" is up to you).  Also, there\\'s a lot of glass\\naround you which I wasn\\'t expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty\\nhot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about\\nthe lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with\\nthe heat.  I\\'ve heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine.\\nLeather and the keyless entry system weren\\'t available when I got the car so\\nI can\\'t comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).  \\nI prefer cloth to leather anyway.  \\n\\nI wouldn\\'t want this car in the snow:  The suspension is too rough for the\\ninevitable surprise potholes, tires aren\\'t meant for snow, and the seats assume\\nthat you\\'re not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is much better:  water \\ngenerally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper\\ncontrols are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the\\nEagles (and I was really trying).  \\nThere is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.

The problems you present are exist anyway,\\nand I didn't tried to solve them at all, because I would not make such\\nproblems to my programs in the first place.\\n\\nGamma and color corrections are easily done to 24bit image\\nas I presented. There's no need make tricks from 8bit/quantized image\\nback to 24 bit image.\\n\\n\\n\\nOk, you're writing about situation that user want edit images as 24bit\\nand user want edit individual colors -- your questions, by the way,\\njumps off the discussion a bit.\\n\\nMy solution doesn't work, because there's no colormap withing real 24bit\\nimage -- you see, user see 24bit image; going back to 8bit is silly.\\n\\n\\nAbout changing individual colors in 8bit/quantized/rasterized image:\\nchanging individual colors in colormap is useless in most\\ncases if the image is quantized and rasterized -- small change may\\nmake serious errors to anywhere in the image.\\nXV allows this feature, but I don't recommend to use it with the\\nmentioned type images.\\n\\nMoreover, XV is not a paint program; you can only make those global\\nchanges. In full 24bit XV, changing individual colors sounds like\\npaint program job.\\nIf person have 8bit screen, there's need for tricks to get the\\noriginal 24bit image modified. Because user don't see full 24bit\\nimage, there's need to make approximations and it is not possible to\\nmodify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups (if\\nimage is rasterized). To select indiavidual color, there could be 7x7\\ncursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area --\\nselecting individual color is possible from that.\\n\\nOk, I don't have thought very much 24bit painting programs, never seen\\nsuch in good view and are not planned to make such. Not to mention\\n24bit painting program in 8bit screen...\\n\\n\\n\\nIt saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not\\ndesigned for that.\\nAlso, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; say,\\nperson would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is\\nexpected that the image still is the same. So, XV were designed\\nwithout thinking about human interface and how human expect the\\nprogram work -- design error.\\n\\nI have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but\\nit were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making\\nmajor change to the original design.\\n\\nSo, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved\\nimages could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.\\n\\nBefore anybody will make a note: yes, I may as well make a lift where\\n'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes\\nup, and put a note on this design solution to the manuals -- however,\\neven the manuals tells the correct situation, it doesn't solve the problem.\\n(Americans: the lift is just an example :)\\n\\n\\nWell, my text may be a bit hard reading, hopefully you suggeeded to\\nread it.\\n\",\n",
